## 1. Introduction: Cosmic Ray Arrival

Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that originate from astrophysical sources. When they arrive at Earth, their directions are observed to be highly **isotropic**, meaning they come uniformly from all directions.

**Why are they isotropic?**  
Their paths are randomized by interactions with interstellar and interplanetary magnetic fields during their long journey. This process is called *isotropization*.

The fundamental interaction governing this is the **Lorentz Force**:

$$
\frac{dp}{dt} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

- In the vastness of space, the plasma is generally neutral, so the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is assumed to be zero.  
- The particle's trajectory is therefore dominated by the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

Under a constant magnetic field, a charged particle will spiral, with a characteristic **Larmor Radius** (or gyro-radius):

$$
r_g = \frac{p_\perp}{|q|B}
$$

This radius defines the scale of the particle's interaction with the magnetic field.

## 2. The Physics of Propagation: From Random Walks to Diffusion

Cosmic ray propagation is not a straight line but a "random walk" caused by **magnetic irregularities** in interstellar space. The nature of this walk depends on the particle's Larmor radius ($r_g$) relative to the scale of the magnetic irregularities ($l_B$).

1. **$r_g \ll l_B$:** The particle is tightly bound to and spirals along the magnetic field line, drifting slowly.  
2. **$r_g \gg l_B$:** The particle is very energetic and its path is too "stiff" to be affected by small irregularities. It effectively ignores them.  
3. **$r_g \sim l_B$:** **Resonant Scattering.** The particle's trajectory is significantly deflected. This is the most effective regime for randomizing the particle's path.

This random walk process can be mathematically described as **diffusion**.

### Fick's Law of Diffusion

Diffusion describes the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

- **Microscopic Picture:** The net flow (or flux, $\phi$) of particles depends on the difference in number density ($n_-$ vs $n_+$) across a boundary and the particle's microscopic velocity ($v$):

  $$
  \phi_x \approx (n_- - n_+)v
  $$

- This difference in density is proportional to the **concentration gradient** ($\nabla n$).

- **Fick's First Law:**  

  $$
  \phi = -D \nabla n
  $$

  where $D$ is the **diffusion coefficient**.

**The Physical Meaning of the Diffusion Coefficient (D):**

- $v$ (Microscopic Velocity): Faster particles naturally spread out more quickly.  
- $l$ (Mean Free Path): The farther a particle travels on average before being scattered, the more effectively it moves from one region to another.  

So,  

$$
D \propto v \times l
$$

It fundamentally combines *how fast* particles move with *how far* they go between interactions.

## 3. The Full Transport Equation

The overall evolution of the cosmic ray number density $n$ is described by a continuity equation that accounts for all processes that can add or remove particles from a given volume in space and energy.

$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla n) - \frac{\partial}{\partial E}(n \dot{E}) + Q
$$

This is the **Diffusion-Loss Equation**. The terms represent:

- $\partial n / \partial t$: The change in number density over time.  
- $\nabla \cdot (D \nabla n)$: **Spatial Diffusion.** How particles spread out in space.  
- $-\partial/\partial E (n\dot{E})$: **Energy Loss/Gain.** How particles move through energy space (e.g., losing energy continuously).  
- $Q$: **Source Term.** The rate at which new cosmic rays are injected (e.g., from supernovae).  

### Adding Convection and Adiabatic Energy Loss

When cosmic rays travel through a moving medium, like the **solar wind**, two additional effects must be considered.

1. **Convection:** The bulk motion of the medium "drags" the cosmic rays with it. This adds a convective flux term: $Vn$.  

   The total flux becomes:  
   $$
   \phi = -D\nabla n + Vn
   $$

2. **Adiabatic Energy Loss:** If the medium is expanding, the particles do work on the expanding magnetic fields and lose energy.  

   The rate of momentum loss is:  
   $$
   \dot{p} = - \frac{1}{3} (\nabla \cdot V) p
   $$

**Convection Speed vs. Momentum Loss**

- **Convection Speed ($V$):** The bulk speed of the medium itself, like the solar wind flowing outward. It's like a river's current carrying leaves downstream.  
- **Adiabatic Momentum Loss ($\dot{p}$):** A consequence of convection in an *expanding* medium. The key term is $\nabla \cdot V$, representing the expansion rate. Cosmic rays lose momentum because they do work on the receding magnetic fields.  

**Diffusion–Convection Equation:**

$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D\nabla n - Vn) - \frac{\partial}{\partial E}(n \dot{E}) + Q
$$

## 4. Application I: Solar Modulation & The Force-Field Approximation

This framework can describe how the cosmic ray spectrum is *modulated* (changed) as it enters our solar system.

**Goal:** Relate the spectrum measured near Earth to the pristine **Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS).**

**Assumptions (Steady State):**

- The system is in a steady state ($\partial n/\partial t = 0$).  
- There are no sources inside the solar system ($Q = 0$).  

Under these assumptions, the transport equation can be solved. A key result is that the **phase space density ($f$) is conserved along a particle's trajectory.**

### Conservation of Phase Space Density

$$
df = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(r_\odot, p_\odot) = f(r_{\text{LIS}}, p_{\text{LIS}})
$$

**Interpretation:**

- **Math:** A total derivative of zero means the function is constant along a specific path. Like walking along a contour line on a mountain: your altitude doesn’t change.  
- **Physics:** The same group of particles observed near Earth with momentum $p_\odot$ existed in interstellar space with momentum $p_{\text{LIS}}$. The cloud in phase space simply shifted; no particles were created or lost.

### The Modulation Potential ($\phi$)

- Quantifies the **average energy loss** of cosmic rays due to the solar wind.  
- Example: $\phi = 500 \, \text{MV}$ → ~500 MeV lost.  
- In the **Force-Field Approximation**:

  $$
  \phi \approx p_{\text{LIS}} - p_\odot
  $$

This lets us relate intensity at Earth to the LIS intensity.

## 5. Application II: Galactic Propagation & The Leaky Box Model

Modeling cosmic ray propagation in the entire galaxy is complex. The **Leaky Box Model** is a simplification:

- The galaxy is treated as a container or "box" (disk + halo).  
  1. **Sources:** Cosmic rays are created inside.  
  2. **Homogeneity:** They diffuse and mix, creating uniform density $n$.  
  3. **Leakage:** The box is “leaky,” and particles can escape to intergalactic space.  

### Key Concept: Escape Time ($T_{\text{esc}}$)

The approximation replaces the spatial diffusion term:

$$
D\nabla^2 n \;\to\; -\frac{n}{T_{\text{esc}}(E)}
$$

- $T_{\text{esc}}(E)$: average time a cosmic ray of energy $E$ remains confined.  
- Energy-dependent: high-energy particles escape faster.

### The Leaky Box Equation

In equilibrium:

$$
Q(E) = \frac{n(E)}{T_{\text{esc}}(E)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n(E) = Q(E) \times T_{\text{esc}}(E)
$$

This shows that the observed number of cosmic rays is a direct balance between **source strength ($Q$)** and **escape time ($T_{\text{esc}}$)**.
