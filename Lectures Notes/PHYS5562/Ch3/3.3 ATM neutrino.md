## 1. Production of Atmospheric Neutrinos

### 1.1 Cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere

Primary cosmic rays (mostly protons) collide with air nuclei (mainly nitrogen and oxygen):

$$  
p_{\text{CR}} + N_{\text{air}} \rightarrow \text{hadrons (mostly } \pi^{\pm},,K^{\pm} \text{)} + \dots  
$$

Here

- (p_{\text{CR}}): incoming cosmic-ray proton,
    
- (N_{\text{air}}): atmospheric nucleus,
    
- final state: many hadrons, especially charged pions and kaons which later decay to muons and neutrinos.
    

These interactions start an **air shower** that produces mesons, muons, and finally atmospheric neutrinos.

### 1.2 Pion–muon decay chain and flavor ratios

Main chain for positive pions:

$$  
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu  
$$

This is a two-body weak decay of a spin-0 pion into a positive muon and a muon neutrino.

The muon then decays via a three-body weak decay:

$$  
\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_\mu  
$$

Here

- (e^+): positron,
    
- (\nu_e): electron neutrino,
    
- (\bar{\nu}_\mu): muon antineutrino.
    

Counting neutrinos per (\pi^+) decay:

- From pion: one (\nu_\mu).
    
- From muon: one (\nu_e) and one (\bar{\nu}_\mu).
    

So per (\pi^+):

$$  
\nu_\mu + \bar{\nu}_\mu : \nu_e \approx 2 : 1  
$$

If (\pi^+) and (\pi^-) are produced equally, the same counting holds for the charge-conjugate chains. Hence the **naive flavor ratio at production** is

$$  
\nu_\mu : \nu_e \approx 2 : 1,  
\qquad  
\bar{\nu} : \nu \approx 1 : 1  
$$

## 2. Energy Spectrum of Atmospheric Neutrinos

### 2.1 Primary cosmic-ray spectrum

The differential flux of primary cosmic rays is approximately a power law:

$$  
\phi_{\text{CR}}(E)  
= \frac{dN}{dE,dA,dt,d\Omega}  
\approx \phi_0,E^{-\gamma}  
$$

where

- (\phi_{\text{CR}}(E)): flux per energy, area, time, solid angle,
    
- (\phi_0): normalization constant,
    
- (E): energy,
    
- (\gamma \simeq 2.7): spectral index in the GeV–TeV range.
    

If mesons produced in the atmosphere always decayed immediately and each neutrino carried a fixed fraction of the primary energy, the **neutrino spectrum** would follow the same power law:

$$  
\phi_{\nu}^{\text{naive}}(E) \propto E^{-\gamma} \approx E^{-2.7}  
$$

This is the “naive” spectral expectation, before considering meson re-interactions.

---

### 2.2 Decay length vs interaction length and spectrum steepening

For a meson of mass (m), proper lifetime (\tau), and energy (E), the **decay length** in the lab frame is

$$  
L_{\text{dec}}(E)  
= \gamma c \tau  
= \frac{E}{m c^2},c\tau  
$$

Here

- (\gamma = E/(m c^2)) is the Lorentz factor,
    
- (c) is the speed of light,
    
- (c\tau) is the decay length in the rest frame.
    

The **interaction length** in the atmosphere is

$$  
L_{\text{int}}(E) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{\text{inel}}(E),n_{\text{air}}}  
$$

where

- (\sigma_{\text{inel}}(E)): inelastic cross section with air nuclei,
    
- (n_{\text{air}}): number density of air nuclei.  
    This is the mean distance between inelastic interactions.
    

Define the **critical energy** (E_{\text{crit}}) by

$$  
L_{\text{dec}}(E_{\text{crit}}) = L_{\text{int}}(E_{\text{crit}})  
$$

Solving for (E_{\text{crit}}) gives

$$  
E_{\text{crit}}  
= \frac{m L_{\text{int}}}{\tau}  
$$

At energies

- (E \ll E_{\text{crit}}): mesons typically **decay before interacting**, so neutrino flux tracks the primary spectrum:
    
    $$  
    \phi_{\nu}(E) \propto E^{-\gamma}  
    $$
    
- (E \gg E_{\text{crit}}): mesons tend to **re-interact before decaying**. The probability to decay between interactions is roughly (L_{\text{int}}/L_{\text{dec}} \propto E_{\text{crit}}/E). This adds an extra factor (E^{-1}), making the spectrum steeper:
    
    $$  
    \phi_{\nu}(E) \propto E^{-(\gamma+1)} \approx E^{-3.7}  
    $$
    

This explains why the high-energy atmospheric neutrino spectrum is steeper than the primary cosmic-ray spectrum.

## 3. Pion Decay and Helicity Suppression

### 3.1 Weak interaction Lagrangian for pion decay

At low energies, pion decay is described by the effective four-fermion interaction

$$  
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} =  
-\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud}  
\bigl(\bar{\ell}\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)\nu_\ell\bigr)  
\bigl(\bar{u}\gamma_\mu(1-\gamma^5)d\bigr)  
$$

with

- (G_F): Fermi constant (weak coupling strength),
    
- (V_{ud}): CKM matrix element for (u \leftrightarrow d) transitions,
    
- (\ell): charged lepton field (e or μ),
    
- (\nu_\ell): corresponding neutrino field,
    
- (u, d): up and down quark fields,
    
- ((1-\gamma^5)): projector onto left-chiral components (encodes the V–A structure).
    

The pion (\pi^+) is a bound state (u\bar{d}). Its matrix element with the axial current is

$$  
\langle 0 | \bar{u}\gamma^\mu\gamma^5 d | \pi^+(p) \rangle  
= i f_\pi p^\mu  
$$

where

- (f_\pi): pion decay constant,
    
- (p^\mu): pion four-momentum.
    

This relation allows us to replace the hadronic current with a factor involving (f_\pi) and (p^\mu).

---

### 3.2 Decay amplitude and proportionality to lepton mass

Consider

$$  
\pi^+(p) \rightarrow \ell^+(k) + \nu_\ell(q)  
$$

The amplitude is

$$  
\mathcal{M} =  
i\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud} f_\pi p^\mu  
\bigl[\bar{u}_\ell(k)\gamma_\mu(1-\gamma^5)v_{\nu_\ell}(q)\bigr]  
$$

Here

- (k), (q): four-momenta of the lepton and neutrino,
    
- (\bar{u}_\ell(k)): spinor for outgoing lepton,
    
- (v_{\nu_\ell}(q)): spinor for outgoing neutrino.
    

Using momentum conservation (p = k + q) we write

$$  
p^\mu\gamma_\mu = {p} = {k} + {q}  
$$

Substitute into (\mathcal{M}):

# $$  
\mathcal{M}

i\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud} f_\pi,  
\bar{u}_\ell(k)\bigl({k} + {q}\bigr)(1-\gamma^5)v_{\nu_\ell}(q)  
$$

For a (nearly) massless neutrino we use the Dirac equation

$$  
{q},v_{\nu_\ell}(q) = 0  
$$

so the ({q}) term drops out:

# $$  
\mathcal{M}

i\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud} f_\pi,  
\bar{u}_\ell(k){k}(1-\gamma^5)v_{\nu_\ell}(q)  
$$

For the final-state charged lepton we use

$$  
{k},u_\ell(k) = m_\ell u_\ell(k)  
\quad \Rightarrow \quad  
\bar{u}_\ell(k){k} = m_\ell \bar{u}_\ell(k)  
$$

Substituting gives

$$  
\mathcal{M} =  
i\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ud} f_\pi m_\ell  
\bar{u}_\ell(k)(1-\gamma^5)v_{\nu_\ell}(q)  
$$

Thus the amplitude is **proportional to the lepton mass** (m_\ell). The heavier the lepton, the larger the amplitude. This arises because the spin–angular momentum constraints of a spin-0 pion decay plus the chiral V–A structure effectively require a helicity flip, which is only possible for a massive lepton.

---

### 3.3 Two-body decay width and electron/muon branching ratio

For a two-body decay with parent mass (m_\pi) into final masses (m_\ell) and (m_\nu \simeq 0), the decay width is

$$  
\Gamma(\pi^+ \rightarrow \ell^+ \nu_\ell)  
= \frac{1}{8\pi} \frac{|\mathbf{k}|}{m_\pi^2} |\mathcal{M}|^2  
$$

where (|\mathbf{k}|) is the three-momentum magnitude of either final particle in the pion rest frame.

Using energy–momentum conservation for a massless neutrino, we find

$$  
|\mathbf{k}|  
= \frac{m_\pi^2 - m_\ell^2}{2m_\pi}  
$$

This comes from solving (m_\pi = E_\ell + E_\nu) with (E_\ell^2 = |\mathbf{k}|^2 + m_\ell^2) and (E_\nu = |\mathbf{k}|).

The amplitude squared behaves as

$$  
|\mathcal{M}|^2  
\propto G_F^2 |V_{ud}|^2 f_\pi^2 m_\ell^2 m_\pi^2  
$$

Combining the factors, the decay width becomes

# $$  
\Gamma(\pi^+ \rightarrow \ell^+ \nu_\ell)

\frac{G_F^2 |V_{ud}|^2 f_\pi^2}{8\pi},  
m_\pi m_\ell^2  
\left(1 - \frac{m_\ell^2}{m_\pi^2}\right)^2  
$$

The factor (m_\ell^2) is the **helicity-suppression factor**, and the bracket is the phase-space factor.

The ratio of electron and muon modes is

# $$  
R_{e/\mu}  
\equiv  
\frac{\Gamma(\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e)}  
{\Gamma(\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu)}

\frac{m_e^2}{m_\mu^2}  
\frac{\left(1 - \dfrac{m_e^2}{m_\pi^2}\right)^2}  
{\left(1 - \dfrac{m_\mu^2}{m_\pi^2}\right)^2}  
$$

The constants (G_F, V_{ud}, f_\pi, m_\pi) cancel. Since (m_e \ll m_\pi), the numerator’s bracket is essentially 1, and the ratio is dominated by (m_e^2/m_\mu^2), giving (R_{e/\mu} \sim 10^{-4}). Therefore the decay (\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e) is strongly **helicity suppressed** compared to (\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu).

---

## 4. Muon Decay vs Travel Distance (Effect on ( \nu_e ) Flux)

Muon lifetime at rest:

$$  
\tau_\mu \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}  
$$

Multiplying by the speed of light (c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}) gives the **rest-frame decay length**

$$  
c\tau_\mu \approx 3.0\times 10^8\ \text{m/s} \times 2.2\times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}  
\approx 660\ \text{m}  
$$

In the lab frame, for Lorentz factor (\gamma), the decay length is

$$  
L_{\text{dec}} = \gamma c \tau_\mu  
$$

Assuming a typical production height (L_{\text{atm}} \approx 30,\text{km}), the Lorentz factor where the muon just reaches the ground before decaying satisfies

$$  
L_{\text{dec}} = L_{\text{atm}}  
\quad\Rightarrow\quad  
\gamma = \frac{L_{\text{atm}}}{c\tau_\mu}  
\approx \frac{30,000\ \text{m}}{660\ \text{m}}  
\approx 45  
$$

The corresponding lab energy is

$$  
E_\mu = \gamma m_\mu c^2  
\approx 45 \times 0.105\ \text{GeV}  
\approx 5\ \text{GeV}  
$$

So

- For (E_\mu \lesssim 5\ \text{GeV}): many muons **decay in the atmosphere**, producing (\nu_e) and (\bar{\nu}_\mu).
    
- For (E_\mu \gtrsim 5\ \text{GeV}): many muons **reach the ground before decaying**, reducing (\nu_e) production.
    

This explains the suppression of atmospheric (\nu_e) flux relative to (\nu_\mu) at higher energies.

---

## 5. Kaon Contribution and High-Energy Behavior

Kaons also contribute significantly to the atmospheric neutrino flux, especially at high energies. They have their own critical energy:

$$  
E_{\text{crit}}^\pi \sim 10^2\ \text{GeV},  
\qquad  
E_{\text{crit}}^K \sim 10^3\ \text{GeV}  
$$

Here (E_{\text{crit}}^\pi) and (E_{\text{crit}}^K) are the energies at which decay and interaction lengths for pions and kaons are equal.

- For (E \lesssim E_{\text{crit}}^\pi): pions decay efficiently and dominate (\nu_\mu) production.
    
- For (E_{\text{crit}}^\pi \lesssim E \lesssim E_{\text{crit}}^K): pion decays are suppressed; kaons still decay efficiently and dominate the high-energy (\nu_\mu) flux.
    
- For (E \gtrsim E_{\text{crit}}^K): even kaons interact before decaying, and the (\nu_\mu) spectrum steepens toward the (E^{-(\gamma+1)}) regime.

## 6. Angular Distribution of Atmospheric Neutrinos

### 6.1 Thin spherical shell picture

Treat the atmosphere as a thin spherical shell around the Earth. A detector on or near the surface sits inside this shell. A surface element of area (dA) emits neutrinos; those that reach the detector leave the surface at a local angle (\theta_e) with respect to the local normal and arrive at the detector with zenith angle (\theta).

Two limiting models:

1. **Isotropic point sources in the shell (case A)**  
    Each point source in the shell emits isotropically. The line of sight toward the **horizon** passes tangentially through the shell and intercepts a long path, so many sources contribute. The line of sight **vertically** intercepts a much shorter path. Therefore the intensity is strongly **peaked at the horizon**.
    
2. **Blackbody (Lambertian) emitter in the shell**  
    A radiating surface in equilibrium satisfies Lambert’s cosine law:
    
    $$  
    \frac{dL}{dA} \propto \cos\theta_e  
    $$
    
    where (dL) is the emitted power into a given direction per unit area, (dA) is the area element, and (\theta_e) is the angle between the emission direction and the surface normal.
    
    Derivation: take constant radiance (I) (power per unit projected area per unit solid angle). The projected area in direction (\theta_e) is (dA\cos\theta_e), so the power into solid angle (d\Omega) is
    
    $$  
    dL = I , (dA\cos\theta_e) , d\Omega  
    $$
    
    Hence (dL/dA \propto \cos\theta_e). For a thin spherical layer with such emission, the longer path length toward the horizon is canceled by the (\cos\theta_e) factor, and the observed intensity is **isotropic**.
    

Atmospheric neutrinos sit between these extremes: they are produced in a shell with non-trivial angular distributions from meson production and decay, but overall geometry ensures the flux is approximately **symmetric about the horizon** (ignoring oscillations and Earth absorption).

## 7. Interaction Types of Atmospheric Neutrinos in Matter

Atmospheric neutrinos interacting with nuclei inside a detector do so mainly via:

1. **Charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE)**
    
    $$  
    \nu_\ell + n \rightarrow \ell^- + p  
    $$
    
    A neutrino converts a neutron into a proton and produces a charged lepton of flavor (\ell). The final state is usually one visible lepton plus a nucleon that may or may not be above Cherenkov threshold.
    
2. **Resonant (RES)**
    
    $$  
    \nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell^- + \Delta  
    $$  
    $$  
    \Delta \rightarrow N + \pi  
    $$
    
    The neutrino excites a baryon resonance (\Delta), which decays into a nucleon plus a pion. This is important at a few GeV.
    
3. **Deep inelastic scattering (DIS)**
    
    $$  
    \nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell^- + \text{multiple hadrons}  
    $$
    
    At higher energies the neutrino scatters on quarks inside the nucleon, leading to many hadrons in the final state.
    

The relative importance of CCQE, RES, and DIS changes with energy and affects event topologies in the detector.

## 8. Detector Signatures: Electron-Like vs Muon-Like Events

In water Cherenkov detectors such as Super-Kamiokande:

- (\nu_e, \bar{\nu}_e) charged-current interactions produce electrons/positrons → **electron-like events**.
    
- (\nu_\mu, \bar{\nu}_\mu) charged-current interactions produce muons/anti-muons → **muon-like events**.
    

Charged leptons moving faster than light in water emit **Cherenkov radiation**, forming light cones that project as rings on the detector wall.

### 8.1 Electron-like events (fuzzy rings)

Electrons are light; at detector energies their energy loss is dominated by electromagnetic showers:

- An energetic electron emits bremsstrahlung photons.
    
- Photons convert to (e^+e^-) pairs.
    
- New electrons and positrons radiate again.
    

This produces many short, slightly scattered tracks. Each emits Cherenkov light, so the overlap of many cones produces:

- A **fuzzy ring** pattern with significant light inside the ring.
    
- Edges are not sharp.
    

These are classified as **electron-like events**.

### 8.2 Muon-like events (clean rings)

Muons are 200 times heavier than electrons. In the GeV range:

- Energy loss is dominated by **ionization**, not by bremsstrahlung or pair production.
    
- Muons travel in long, nearly straight tracks.
    
- Cherenkov light is emitted steadily along one track.
    

This gives:

- A **clean, sharp ring** with a distinct edge and relatively little light inside.
    
- Events are classified as **muon-like**.
    

The difference in ring morphology lets experiments distinguish between (\nu_e) and (\nu_\mu) interactions.

---

## 9. Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations (Two-Flavor Approximation)

Super-Kamiokande observed:

- Electron-like events close to expectation.
    
- Muon-like events suppressed, especially for up-going directions (neutrinos crossing the Earth).
    

This is evidence of (\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau) oscillations.

### 9.1 Flavor–mass mixing and oscillation probability

For two-flavor mixing between flavors (a) and (b) with mixing angle (\theta), and mass eigenstates (\nu_1), (\nu_2), we write

# $$  
\begin{pmatrix}  
\nu_a \  
\nu_b  
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}  
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \  
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta  
\end{pmatrix}  
\begin{pmatrix}  
\nu_1 \  
\nu_2  
\end{pmatrix}  
$$

A neutrino produced as flavor (a) at (t=0) is

$$  
|\nu_a(0)\rangle  
= \cos\theta,|\nu_1\rangle

- \sin\theta,|\nu_2\rangle  
    $$
    

Each mass eigenstate propagates as

$$  
|\nu_i(t)\rangle = e^{-iE_i t}|\nu_i\rangle,  
\qquad i = 1,2  
$$

so after time (t) the state is

$$  
|\nu(t)\rangle  
= \cos\theta,e^{-iE_1 t}|\nu_1\rangle

- \sin\theta,e^{-iE_2 t}|\nu_2\rangle  
    $$
    

The flavor (b) state is

$$  
|\nu_b\rangle  
= -\sin\theta,|\nu_1\rangle

- \cos\theta,|\nu_2\rangle  
    $$
    

The **transition amplitude** is

$$  
A_{a\rightarrow b}(t)  
= \langle\nu_b|\nu(t)\rangle  
= \sin\theta\cos\theta  
\bigl(e^{-iE_2 t} - e^{-iE_1 t}\bigr)  
$$

The **transition probability** is

$$  
P_{a\rightarrow b}(t)  
= |A_{a\rightarrow b}(t)|^2  
= \sin^2 2\theta  
\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta E,t}{2}\right)  
$$

with (\Delta E = E_2 - E_1).

For ultra-relativistic neutrinos of common energy (E),

$$  
E_i \approx E + \frac{m_i^2}{2E}  
\quad\Rightarrow\quad  
\Delta E \approx \frac{\Delta m^2}{2E}  
$$

where (\Delta m^2 = m_2^2 - m_1^2).

If the neutrino travels distance (L \approx ct), the phase becomes

$$  
\frac{\Delta E,t}{2}  
\approx \frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}  
$$

Converting to convenient units ((\Delta m^2) in eV(^2), (L) in km, (E) in GeV), one finds

$$  
\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}  
= 1.27  
\frac{\Delta m^2\ (\text{eV}^2),L\ (\text{km})}  
{E\ (\text{GeV})}  
$$

Thus the **two-flavor oscillation probability** is

$$  
P_{a\rightarrow b}(L,E)  
= \sin^2 2\theta,  
\sin^2\left(  
1.27  
\frac{\Delta m^2\ (\text{eV}^2),L\ (\text{km})}  
{E\ (\text{GeV})}  
\right)  
$$

For atmospheric neutrinos, (a = \nu_\mu) and (to good approximation) (b = \nu_\tau). The dependence on (L/E) explains the zenith-angle–dependent deficit of muon-neutrino events observed in Super-Kamiokande.
