# Astrophysical Neutrinos — Obsidian Revision Note (Lecture 3.5)

## 0. Big picture

Astrophysical-neutrino physics in this lecture links three things:

1. **Production** (core-collapse supernovae; cosmic-ray interactions making pions).
    
2. **Propagation** (flavour oscillations; matter effects in supernovae; averaging over huge distances).
    
3. **Detection** (muon tracks vs cascades; why high-energy neutrinos are “easier” to detect).
    

---

## 1. Core-collapse supernova neutrinos

### 1.1 Start of collapse → electron capture → deleptonisation

When the iron core collapses, electrons are extremely degenerate and abundant. As density rises, electrons are captured on protons:  
$$  
p^+ + e^- \to n + \nu_e.  
$$  
This:

- **reduces electron number** (loss of electron degeneracy pressure),
    
- **increases neutron fraction** (“neutronization”),
    
- produces lots of **electron neutrinos**.
    

### 1.2 Why neutrinos get trapped (and what “neutrino-sphere” means)

As density rises, neutrino mean free path becomes small. A simple optical-depth style estimate used on the slide is:  
$$  
P \sim n,\sigma,L,  
$$  
where:

- $n$ = target number density,
    
- $\sigma$ = neutrino interaction cross section,
    
- $L$ = path length through matter.
    

The slide gives representative numbers:

- $n \sim 10^{12},\mathrm{g,cm^{-3}} \sim 6\times 10^{35},\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$,
    
- $\sigma \sim 10^{-40},\mathrm{cm^2}$,
    
- $L \gtrsim 1,\mathrm{km}=10^5,\mathrm{cm}$,
    

so $P \sim n\sigma L \gg 1$ → **neutrinos scatter many times** → they are trapped and diffuse.

**Neutrino-sphere**: the effective “surface” where the optical depth is order 1. Inside: diffusion/thermal equilibrium; outside: free streaming (analogous to the Sun’s photon-sphere).

### 1.3 How the _initial shock_ forms (bounce shock)

During collapse, the inner core reaches **nuclear density**. Nuclear matter becomes very stiff (strong-force repulsion + nucleon degeneracy pressure), so the inner core’s collapse halts and **rebounds**. The still-infalling outer core slams into this rebounding inner core, producing a shock.

The slide summarizes this as:

- infall hits a hard layer (proto-neutron-star material),
    
- shock forms between infalling and bounced material.
    

### 1.4 Why the shock “dies” even though neutrinos are escaping

The lecture slide states the key energy sinks:

- Shock energy is lost to **electron-neutrino emission** and **Fe dissociation**,
    
- so it stalls inside the iron core.
    

Mechanism breakdown:

1. **Photodissociation of iron** behind the shock eats energy:
    
    - the shock breaks Fe-group nuclei into free nucleons,
        
    - binding energy cost is huge → thermal/kinetic energy of the shock is consumed.
        
2. **Neutrino losses**:
    
    - electron captures in shocked material emit $\nu_e$ (and related processes),
        
    - energy that could have pushed the shock outward is radiated away as neutrinos.
        
3. **Ram pressure from continued accretion**:
    
    - outer layers keep falling in and push back on the shock.
        

So neutrinos can be streaming out, but **most of that luminosity is not deposited in the right place** with high enough efficiency to keep the shock moving.

### 1.5 Shock revival by neutrino heating

To revive the stalled shock, neutrino absorption heats the post-shock region. The slide lists charged-current heating channels:  
$$  
\nu_e + n \to p + e^-,  
$$  
$$  
\bar{\nu}_e + p \to n + e^+.  
$$  

Interpretation:

- Neutrinos emitted from the hot proto-neutron star stream outward.
    
- A fraction gets absorbed behind the shock → deposits energy → can re-energize the shock and cause explosion.

## 2. Flavours, decoupling, and “energy sphere vs transport sphere” in supernovae

### 2.1 Why $\nu_e$ behaves differently from $\nu_\mu,\nu_\tau$

- $\nu_e,\bar{\nu}_e$ have **charged-current** interactions on nucleons (the heating reactions above), so they typically have **larger opacity**.
    
- $\nu_\mu,\nu_\tau$ (and antiparticles) do not have charged-current reactions at these energies (creating real $\mu,\tau$ is hard), so they mainly do **neutral-current scattering** → different decoupling depth.
    

The lecture notes that reactions with smaller rate decouple faster, and that $\mu/\tau$ flavours “see deeper” into the neutrino sphere and so have higher average temperature.

### 2.2 Energy sphere vs transport sphere (what the slide is telling you)

Conceptually there are two “surfaces”:

- **Energy sphere**: where neutrinos stop efficiently exchanging energy with matter (spectral/thermal decoupling).
    
- **Transport sphere**: where neutrinos stop scattering frequently enough to be trapped (they begin free streaming).
    

For heavy flavours ($\nu_\mu,\nu_\tau$):

- there can be a “scattering atmosphere” between those spheres: neutrinos random-walk outward (diffusion), but with less energy exchange than deep inside.
    

---

## 3. If a black hole forms: what is “Case 3 (Metastable PNS)”?

The slide states:

- BH can form if enough accretion triggers collapse of the neutron star,
    
- if it happens **before shock revival** → failed supernova,
    
- and the neutrino light curve ends abruptly, with higher average energy.
    

### 3.1 Three qualitative cases (matching the figure)

1. **Case 1: PNS cooling → neutron star**
    
    - Shock successfully revives, explosion occurs.
        
    - Remnant stays a neutron star; neutrino luminosity gradually declines over seconds–tens of seconds.
        
2. **Case 2: Failed SN (early BH)**
    
    - Shock not revived (or revives too weakly), accretion continues.
        
    - Core exceeds maximum supportable mass → collapses into BH quickly.
        
    - Neutrino signal **cuts off early** (very abrupt).
        
3. **Case 3: Metastable PNS (delayed BH)**
    
    - A proto-neutron star forms and emits neutrinos like a normal case initially.
        
    - But it is **metastable**: continued accretion (and/or an evolving equation of state, e.g. appearance of exotic components) reduces stability.
        
    - After some delay (seconds), it collapses into a BH.
        
    - Observational signature: neutrino luminosity declines for a while, then **suddenly terminates** when the BH forms.
        

### 3.2 Your question tied in

**“So if shock is not revived or happens early, then black hole will form?”**

- Not revived → **much more likely** to form BH (failed SN), because accretion continues and mass grows.
    
- “Revives early” does _not_ automatically mean BH; early revival usually helps explode, but BH can still form later if the remnant becomes too massive (that’s essentially **Case 3**).

## 4. Muon energy loss (why muons travel far in neutrino telescopes)

### 4.1 The parameterization on the slide

The slide uses:  
$$  
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dE}{dx} \simeq \alpha + \beta E,  
$$  
with approximate constants:  
$$  
\alpha \simeq 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{TeV,cm^2,g^{-1}},\qquad  
\beta \simeq 4\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{cm^2,g^{-1}}.  
$$  

Meanings:

- $\rho$ = material density.
    
- $\alpha$ term = roughly constant **ionization** loss (dominates at lower energies).
    
- $\beta E$ term = **radiative** processes (bremsstrahlung, pair production, photonuclear) that grow with $E$.
    

### 4.2 Deriving the “range” estimate

If energy loss is approximately constant-ish over some interval, a crude range is:  
$$  
R \sim \frac{E}{dE/dx}.  
$$  
The slide plugs a 100 GeV muon into this idea and gets an order-km range in water/ice.

More systematically, from  
$$  
\frac{dE}{dx} \simeq \rho(\alpha+\beta E),  
$$  
separate variables:  
$$  
\frac{dE}{\alpha+\beta E} \simeq \rho,dx.  
$$  
Integrate from $E_0$ to $E$ and from $0$ to $x$:  
$$  
\int_{E_0}^{E}\frac{dE'}{\alpha+\beta E'} = \rho \int_0^x dx'.  
$$  
Left-hand side:  
$$  
\int\frac{dE'}{\alpha+\beta E'}=\frac{1}{\beta}\ln(\alpha+\beta E').  
$$  
So:  
$$  
\frac{1}{\beta}\ln\left(\frac{\alpha+\beta E}{\alpha+\beta E_0}\right)=\rho x,  
$$  
and solving for distance to reduce from $E_0$ to $E$:  
$$  
x=\frac{1}{\rho\beta}\ln\left(\frac{\alpha+\beta E_0}{\alpha+\beta E}\right).  
$$  
This shows explicitly why high-energy muons can travel long distances (logarithmically growing range).

## 5. Cosmic rays ↔ neutrinos and the Waxman–Bahcall style bound

### 5.1 UHECR and an $E^{-2}$ source spectrum

The slide assumes UHECR sources with an $E^{-2}$-like spectrum and quotes a normalization in the standard “flat” plot variable:  
$$  
E^2\frac{dN_{\rm CR}}{dE}\sim 3\times 10^{-8}\ \mathrm{GeV,cm^{-2},s^{-1},sr^{-1}}.  
$$  

### 5.2 Relating neutrino energy flux to cosmic-ray energy flux

The key connection written is:  
$$  
E_\nu^2\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\ \simeq\ \xi,\epsilon,\frac{1}{4},E_p^2\frac{dN_{\rm CR}}{dE_p}.  
$$  

Explain each factor:

- $E_p$ = parent proton energy (cosmic ray).
    
- $E_\nu$ = neutrino energy.
    
- $\epsilon<1$ = **fraction of proton energy lost to pion production before escaping the source**.
    
- $\xi\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ = accounts for **source evolution with redshift + propagation energy losses** (how many sources at high $z$, etc.).
    
- $1/4$ = rough bookkeeping of how energy is partitioned into neutrinos per interaction/decay chain (order-of-magnitude).
    

### 5.3 Why “1/2” shows up on the next slide (charged vs neutral pions)

The multimessenger slide notes:

- only about **half** the pion energy goes into **charged** pions (the rest into $\pi^0$),  
    and gives the photopion channels:  
    $$  
    p+\gamma \to n+\pi^+,  
    $$  
    $$  
    p+\gamma \to p+\pi^0,  
    $$  
    and the charged-pion decay chain:  
    $$  
    \pi^+ \to e^+ + \nu_\mu + \bar{\nu}_\mu + \nu_e.  
    $$  
    

Interpretation:

- **Neutrinos** come mainly from $\pi^\pm$ decays.
    
- **Gamma rays** come mainly from $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ (not written on that slide, but that’s the standard link).
    
- Therefore neutrino production is tied to both cosmic-ray escape and gamma-ray emission.
    

### 5.4 What the “multi-component” plot is doing (constraint vs verification)

Your question: **“Is that plot a constraint rather than a verification?”**

Yes: it is mostly a **consistency/constraint** diagram:

- If a model predicts too many neutrinos, it would overshoot measured neutrino fluxes _and/or_ imply too much accompanying gamma-ray emission or too much energy loss compared to observed UHECR.
    
- The slide explicitly warns “careful about the assumptions.”
    

### 5.5 What are “gap B” and “gap C” (from the labeled figure you showed)

**Gap B (vertical gap, flux normalization)**  
This represents a **difference in _energy flux level_** between:

- the UHECR proton energy flux scale (green “proton $E^{-2}$” line),  
    and
    
- the neutrino flux scale (green dashed horizontal guide).
    

Physically it’s controlled by factors like:

- pion-production efficiency $\epsilon$ (how much CR energy is converted),
    
- redshift evolution factor $\xi$,
    
- branching/partition factors (charged vs neutral pions; neutrino energy fractions).  
    This is exactly the kind of scaling summarized by the lecture’s relation  
    $$  
    E_\nu^2\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\ \simeq\ \xi,\epsilon,\frac{1}{4},E_p^2\frac{dN_{\rm CR}}{dE_p}.  
    $$  
    

**Gap C (horizontal gap, energy mapping)**  
This represents a **shift in _energy_** between:

- the energy scale of parent UHECR protons,  
    and
    
- the energy scale of neutrinos produced in photopion processes / cosmogenic production.
    

Rule of thumb: neutrinos carry only a **few percent** of the parent proton energy, so neutrino features appear at **lower $E$** than the CR features → hence a horizontal displacement.

**Difference (B vs C):**

- **B** = “how much flux” (normalization / efficiency).
    
- **C** = “at what energy” (kinematic energy fraction mapping from $E_p$ to $E_\nu$).

## 6. Neutrino flavour oscillations: “normal distance” vs “cosmological distance”

### 6.1 Two-flavour mixing setup (as on the slide)

# Define flavour and mass eigenstates with a mixing angle $\theta$:  
$$  
\begin{pmatrix}|\nu_e\rangle\|\nu_\mu\rangle\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}  
\cos\theta & \sin\theta\  
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta  
\end{pmatrix}  
\begin{pmatrix}|\nu_1\rangle\|\nu_2\rangle\end{pmatrix}.  
$$  

So if you produce a $|\nu_e\rangle$, the amplitudes in mass basis are:  
$$  
|\nu_e\rangle = \cos\theta,|\nu_1\rangle + \sin\theta,|\nu_2\rangle.  
$$

### 6.2 Propagation phases (derivation of oscillation probability)

Each mass state propagates with its own phase:  
$$  
|\nu_i(L)\rangle = e^{-iE_i t}|\nu_i\rangle.  
$$  
For ultra-relativistic neutrinos ($E\gg m_i$), expand:  
$$  
E_i = \sqrt{p^2+m_i^2}\approx p+\frac{m_i^2}{2E},  
$$  
and take $t\simeq L$ (with $c=1$). The common $e^{-ipL}$ drops out in probabilities, leaving **relative** phase:  
$$  
e^{-i\frac{m_i^2L}{2E}}.  
$$

# So the propagated state from an initial electron neutrino is:  
$$  
|\nu(L)\rangle

\cos\theta,e^{-i\frac{m_1^2L}{2E}}|\nu_1\rangle  
+  
\sin\theta,e^{-i\frac{m_2^2L}{2E}}|\nu_2\rangle.  
$$

# Project back onto $|\nu_e\rangle$ using  
$$  
\langle \nu_e| = \cos\theta,\langle \nu_1| + \sin\theta,\langle \nu_2|.  
$$  
Amplitude:  
$$  
A_{ee}(L)=\langle \nu_e|\nu(L)\rangle

\cos^2\theta,e^{-i\frac{m_1^2L}{2E}}  
+\sin^2\theta,e^{-i\frac{m_2^2L}{2E}}.  
$$  
Probability:  
$$  
P_{ee}(L)=|A_{ee}(L)|^2.  
$$  
Compute it explicitly:  
$$  
\begin{aligned}  
P_{ee}  
&=  
\left|\cos^2\theta,e^{-i\phi_1}+\sin^2\theta,e^{-i\phi_2}\right|^2\  
&=  
\cos^4\theta+\sin^4\theta+2\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta\cos(\phi_2-\phi_1),  
\end{aligned}  
$$  
where  
$$  
\phi_i=\frac{m_i^2L}{2E},\qquad \phi_2-\phi_1=\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{2E},\qquad \Delta m^2=m_2^2-m_1^2.  
$$  
Use identities:  
$$  
\cos^4\theta+\sin^4\theta = 1-2\sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta = 1-\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(2\theta),  
$$  
and  
$$  
1-\cos\Delta = 2\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta}{2}\right),  
$$  
to rewrite:  
$$  
P_{ee}=1-\sin^2(2\theta),\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}\right).  
$$  
This matches the slide expression.

### 6.3 “Normal distance” (coherent) vs “cosmological distance” (averaged/decoherent)

**Normal (laboratory/solar-system scale, narrow $L/E$):**

- You can resolve the oscillatory term  
    $$  
    \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}\right)  
    $$  
    and $P_{ee}(L,E)$ varies with $L/E$.
    

**Cosmological/astrophysical (huge baselines + energy spread):**

- Oscillations are “fast” compared to the baseline/energy resolution, so the $\sin^2$ term effectively averages:  
    $$  
    \left\langle \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}\right)\right\rangle \to \frac{1}{2}.  
    $$  
    Then:  
    $$  
    \langle P_{ee}\rangle = 1-\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(2\theta)=\cos^4\theta+\sin^4\theta,  
    $$  
    which is also written on the slide.

## 7. “Full probability” simplification for astrophysical flavour ratios (3 flavours)

### 7.1 Start from the general coherent probability

# For 3 flavours, the amplitude is:  
$$  
A_{\alpha\to\beta}(L)

\sum_{i=1}^{3} U_{\beta i},e^{-i\frac{m_i^2L}{2E}},U_{\alpha i}^*,  
$$  
so the probability is:  
$$  
P_{\alpha\to\beta}(L)=|A_{\alpha\to\beta}(L)|^2.  
$$

Expand:  
$$  
\begin{aligned}  
P_{\alpha\to\beta}  
&=  
\left(\sum_i U_{\beta i}e^{-i\phi_i}U_{\alpha i}^*\right)  
\left(\sum_j U_{\beta j}^*e^{+i\phi_j}U_{\alpha j}\right)\  
&=  
\sum_{i,j}  
U_{\beta i}U_{\beta j}^*U_{\alpha i}^*U_{\alpha j},  
e^{-i(\phi_i-\phi_j)}\  
&=  
\sum_{i,j}  
U_{\beta i}U_{\beta j}^*U_{\alpha i}^*U_{\alpha j},  
e^{-i\frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2L}{2E}},  
\end{aligned}  
$$  
where  
$$  
\Delta m_{ij}^2=m_i^2-m_j^2.  
$$

### 7.2 Averaging/decoherence at cosmological distances

# Over enormous baselines and broad energy bins, the oscillatory phases vary rapidly, and the cross terms $i\neq j$ average to zero:  
$$  
\left\langle e^{-i\frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2L}{2E}}\right\rangle \to 0\quad (i\neq j),  
$$  
leaving only $i=j$:  
$$  
\langle P_{\alpha\to\beta}\rangle

\sum_i |U_{\beta i}|^2,|U_{\alpha i}|^2.  
$$

### 7.3 From probabilities to _flavour ratios_ (the slide’s formula)

Let the source flavour fractions be $f_\alpha$ (with $\alpha=e,\mu,\tau$). The detected fraction $f_\beta$ is
$$
f_\beta=\sum_\alpha f_\alpha\,\langle P_{\alpha\to\beta}\rangle.
$$

For cosmological baselines (phase-averaged),
$$
\langle P_{\alpha\to\beta}\rangle=\sum_i |U_{\alpha i}|^2\,|U_{\beta i}|^2,
$$
so
$$
f_\beta=\sum_\alpha f_\alpha \sum_i |U_{\alpha i}|^2\,|U_{\beta i}|^2.
$$

Swap the order of the sums:
$$
f_\beta=\sum_i |U_{\beta i}|^2\left(\sum_\alpha |U_{\alpha i}|^2 f_\alpha\right).
$$

This matches the slide’s form (using $|U_{\alpha i}^*|^2=|U_{\alpha i}|^2$):
$$
f_\beta=\sum_i |U_{\beta i}|^2\,|U_{\alpha i}^*|^2\,f_\alpha.
$$

### 7.4 Example: pion decay source → near $1:1:1$ at Earth

At production (from $\pi^\pm$ decay chains), a typical flavour mix is:  
$$  
(\nu_e:\nu_\mu:\nu_\tau)_{\rm source}\approx (1:2:0).  
$$  
The slide says this becomes close to $(1:1:1)$ at Earth after oscillations/averaging.

## 8. “Include our conversation” — quick Q&A / misconceptions

### 8.1 “Which decouple is related to CMB?”

- **CMB** is linked to **photon decoupling** (a.k.a. recombination / last scattering): photons stop scattering on free electrons and free-stream to us.
    
- **Neutrino decoupling** happens much earlier; it affects things like radiation density ($N_{\rm eff}$) but it is not “the CMB” itself.
    

### 8.2 “So neutrinos escape before shock revival?”

Yes:

- Neutrinos are produced early and, after the neutrino-sphere forms, they diffuse out and eventually free-stream.
    
- Shock revival is later and requires _some fraction_ of the neutrino luminosity to be absorbed behind the shock.
    

### 8.3 “If neutrinos keep escaping, why is the shock dead?”

Because “neutrino luminosity exists” $\neq$ “enough energy is deposited behind the shock.”

- The shock loses energy to Fe dissociation and neutrino emission and stalls.
    
- Only a modest fraction of neutrinos are absorbed in the gain region (heating reactions), so without sufficient heating efficiency + favourable accretion conditions, the shock still fails.
    

### 8.4 “For non-relativistic species, shouldn’t density just $n m$?”

Energy density:

- Rest-mass dominated: $$\rho \approx n m.$$
    
- More accurate thermal correction (ideal non-relativistic gas): $$\rho \approx n m + \frac{3}{2}nT.$$  
    In early-universe or stellar-core contexts, whether you keep the $\tfrac{3}{2}nT$ term depends on whether thermal energy is negligible compared to rest mass.

## 9. Key equations (copy-ready)

Supernova heating:  
$$  
\nu_e + n \to p + e^-,  
\qquad  
\bar{\nu}_e + p \to n + e^+.  
$$  

Muon energy loss:  
$$  
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dE}{dx} \simeq \alpha + \beta E.  
$$  

Waxman–Bahcall style scaling:  
$$  
E_\nu^2\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\ \simeq\ \xi,\epsilon,\frac{1}{4},E_p^2\frac{dN_{\rm CR}}{dE_p}.  
$$  

Two-flavour survival probability:  
$$  
P_{ee}=1-\sin^2(2\theta),\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2L}{4E}\right).  
$$  

Averaged 3-flavour probability:  
$$  
\langle P_{\alpha\to\beta}\rangle=\sum_i |U_{\beta i}|^2|U_{\alpha i}|^2.  
$$

Flavour ratios at Earth:  
$$  
f_\beta=\sum_\alpha f_\alpha,\langle P_{\alpha\to\beta}\rangle  
=\sum_i |U_{\beta i}|^2\left(\sum_\alpha |U_{\alpha i}|^2 f_\alpha\right).  
$$
