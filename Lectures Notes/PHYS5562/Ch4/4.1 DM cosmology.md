## 1) Cosmological structure formation (big picture)

- At early times (around the CMB epoch), the Universe is very uniform, but not perfectly: there are tiny **density fluctuations**.
    
- Gravity amplifies these fluctuations into structures (halos, galaxies, clusters).
    

Key epochs (redshift):

- Matter–radiation transition: $$z \approx 3400$$
    
- Recombination: $$z \approx 1360$$
    
- Photon decoupling: $$z \approx 1100$$
    

### 1.1 Density contrast (overdensity) definition

The slide defines overdensity as:  
$$  
\delta ;=;\frac{\rho}{\bar\rho}-1  
$$

**Derivation (start from the “difference over average” definition):**

1. Define density perturbation relative to the mean:  
    $$  
    \delta ;\equiv;\frac{\rho-\bar\rho}{\bar\rho}  
    $$
    
2. Split the fraction:  
    $$  
    \delta=\frac{\rho}{\bar\rho}-\frac{\bar\rho}{\bar\rho}  
    $$
    
3. Simplify:  
    $$  
    \delta=\frac{\rho}{\bar\rho}-1  
    $$
    

**Meaning of each symbol:**

- $$\rho$$: local matter density at some position.
    
- $$\bar\rho$$: mean (average) density of the Universe at that cosmic time.
    
- $$\delta$$: dimensionless measure of “how overdense/underdense” a region is:
    
    - $$\delta>0$$ overdensity (more matter than average → tends to collapse),
        
    - $$\delta<0$$ underdensity (void-like).
        

### 1.2 Why dark matter grows first, baryons later (concept)

- Before photon decoupling, baryons are tied to photons (a strongly coupled plasma), so baryon perturbations can’t freely collapse; dark matter can start clustering earlier.
    
- After decoupling, baryons fall into the gravitational potential wells made by dark matter halos.
    

---

## 2) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peak

Slide takeaway: BAO produces a preferred **galaxy-pair separation scale**, seen as a peak/bump in clustering statistics; it acts as a **standard ruler**.

### 2.1 Physical story (from our discussion)

- Early Universe = photon–baryon “fluid”.
    
- An overdensity launches an outward-moving pressure wave (sound wave).
    
- The wave stops effectively when photons decouple (photons stop “pushing” baryons).
    
- The frozen radius becomes the **sound horizon** scale.
    
- Today this appears as “slightly more galaxy pairs separated by that distance” → BAO peak.
    

### 2.2 Why the wave stops traveling (from our discussion)

- Before decoupling: photons scatter frequently off electrons → strong pressure support → wave propagates.
    
- After recombination/decoupling: electrons bind to nuclei → neutral atoms form → photons free-stream → pressure coupling drops → baryon sound wave no longer driven → imprint freezes.

## 3) Dark matter halos and the Milky Way

- We live inside a dark matter halo; Milky Way halo is approximately spherical.
    
- Common parametric form: NFW profile (from simulations).
    
- Local DM density near the Sun is around $$\sim 0.3\ \mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$$ (order-of-magnitude).
    

### 3.1 NFW density profile (used model)

Standard NFW form (matching the slide’s structure):  
$$  
\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left(\frac{r}{R_s}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}  
$$

**Explanation of terms:**

- $$r$$: radius from the halo center.
    
- $$R_s$$: scale radius (where the slope transitions).
    
- $$\rho_0$$: scale density (normalization).
    

**What it implies (asymptotic slopes):**

- Inner region $$r\ll R_s$$:
    
    - Approximate $$1+r/R_s \approx 1$$, so  
        $$  
        \rho(r)\approx \frac{\rho_0}{(r/R_s)}=\rho_0\frac{R_s}{r}\propto r^{-1}  
        $$  
        (a “cusp”).
        
- Outer region $$r\gg R_s$$:
    
    - $$1+r/R_s\approx r/R_s$$, so  
        $$  
        \rho(r)\approx \frac{\rho_0}{(r/R_s)(r/R_s)^2}=\rho_0\left(\frac{R_s}{r}\right)^3\propto r^{-3}  
        $$
        

### 3.2 Enclosed mass for NFW (useful derivation for rotation curves)

Start with spherical enclosed mass:  
$$  
M(r)=4\pi\int_0^r \rho(r'),r'^2,dr'  
$$  
Substitute NFW with $$x\equiv r'/R_s$$ so that $$r'=xR_s$$ and $$dr'=R_s,dx$$:

- Rewrite density:  
    $$  
    \rho(r')=\frac{\rho_0}{x(1+x)^2}  
    $$
    
- Replace in the integral:  
    $$  
    M(r)=4\pi\int_{0}^{r/R_s}\frac{\rho_0}{x(1+x)^2},(xR_s)^2,(R_s,dx)  
    $$  
    Simplify:  
    $$  
    M(r)=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3\int_{0}^{r/R_s}\frac{x}{(1+x)^2},dx  
    $$  
    Compute the integral. Let $$u=1+x\Rightarrow x=u-1,\ dx=du$$:  
    $$  
    \int \frac{x}{(1+x)^2}dx=\int \frac{u-1}{u^2}du=\int\left(\frac{1}{u}-\frac{1}{u^2}\right)du  
    $$  
    Integrate:  
    $$  
    \int\left(\frac{1}{u}-\frac{1}{u^2}\right)du=\ln u + \frac{1}{u}+C  
    $$  
    Return to $$x$$:  
    $$  
    =\ln(1+x)+\frac{1}{1+x}+C  
    $$  
    Evaluate from $$0$$ to $$X=r/R_s$$:  
    $$  
    \int_0^X\frac{x}{(1+x)^2}dx=\left[\ln(1+x)+\frac{1}{1+x}\right]_0^X  
    $$  
    $$  
    =\ln(1+X)+\frac{1}{1+X}-\left(\ln 1 +1\right)  
    $$  
    $$  
    =\ln(1+X)+\frac{1}{1+X}-1  
    $$  
    Use $$\frac{1}{1+X}-1=-\frac{X}{1+X}$$:  
    $$  
    \int_0^X\frac{x}{(1+x)^2}dx=\ln(1+X)-\frac{X}{1+X}  
    $$  
    Final enclosed mass:  
    $$  
    M(r)=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3\left[\ln\left(1+\frac{r}{R_s}\right)-\frac{\frac{r}{R_s}}{1+\frac{r}{R_s}}\right]  
    $$
    

**Connection to rotation curve (circular speed):**  
$$  
v_c(r)=\sqrt{\frac{GM(r)}{r}}  
$$

- If baryons dominate inner gravity, extracting $$\rho(r)$$ for DM becomes uncertain (see next).
    

### 3.3 Why inner-halo DM is uncertain (from our discussion + slide)

Slide says inner part has significant uncertainties and is less sensitive to DM mass because gravity is baryon-dominated.

From our discussion (exam logic):

- We infer DM by: **total gravity** − **baryon gravity**.
    
- In the inner Galaxy, baryons are a large fraction of the mass, so you are subtracting two large numbers → big relative uncertainty in the leftover (DM).
    
- Baryon mass distribution is hard (dust extinction, gas tracers, mass-to-light ratio, non-circular motions from the bar).

## 4) (\Lambda)CDM and “cold vs hot” dark matter

Slide: $$\Lambda$$CDM = Cold Dark Matter + cosmological constant, very successful at large scales.

### 4.1 Neutrinos as “original DM candidates” and the density parameter formula

The slide gives:  
$$  
\Omega_\nu=\frac{m_\nu n_\nu}{\rho_{\rm cr}}  
\quad\Rightarrow\quad  
\Omega_\nu h^2=\frac{m_\nu}{94\ \mathrm{eV}}  
$$

#### Derivation (step-by-step)

1. Definition of density parameter for any component $$X$$:  
    $$  
    \Omega_X\equiv \frac{\rho_X}{\rho_{\rm cr}}  
    $$
    
2. For non-relativistic neutrinos today, energy density is mass density:  
    $$  
    \rho_\nu = n_\nu,m_\nu  
    $$  
    (For multiple species, replace $$m_\nu$$ by $$\sum m_\nu$$ and $$n_\nu$$ as total number density.)
    
3. Substitute into $$\Omega_\nu$$:  
    $$  
    \Omega_\nu=\frac{\rho_\nu}{\rho_{\rm cr}}=\frac{n_\nu m_\nu}{\rho_{\rm cr}}  
    $$
    
4. Cosmologists often report $$\Omega h^2$$ because  
    $$  
    \rho_{\rm cr}\propto h^2  
    $$  
    so multiplying by $$h^2$$ removes the explicit Hubble-constant scaling:  
    $$  
    \Omega_\nu h^2=\frac{n_\nu m_\nu}{\rho_{\rm cr}}h^2  
    $$
    
5. Using standard cosmological relic neutrino number density and the standard expression for $$\rho_{\rm cr}$$, the proportionality reduces to the numerical constant:  
    $$  
    \Omega_\nu h^2=\frac{m_\nu}{94\ \mathrm{eV}}  
    $$  
    (as stated on the slide).
    

#### Meaning of each symbol

- $$\Omega_\nu$$: neutrino energy density fraction today.
    
- $$\rho_{\rm cr}$$: critical density today (the density for a spatially flat Universe).
    
- $$n_\nu$$: relic neutrino number density today (set by thermal history).
    
- $$m_\nu$$: neutrino mass (or $$\sum m_\nu$$).
    
- $$h$$: dimensionless Hubble parameter defined by $$H_0=100,h\ \mathrm{km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$$.
    

### 4.2 Why “hot” DM fails (from slide + our discussion)

- If DM were neutrino-like (fast), it free-streams and wipes out small-scale perturbations → structure forms “top-down” (big first, then fragments), which contradicts observed hierarchical formation.
    

---

## 5) Small-scale challenges to (\Lambda)CDM (context)

The lecture flags classic “small-scale problems” (evolving topic): missing satellites, cusp–core, too-big-to-fail.

Key caution:

- Some anomalies may be baryonic-physics modeling limitations (feedback, star formation, tides).
    
- Or could hint at modified DM microphysics.
    

---

## 6) Warm dark matter (WDM)

Warm DM = non-negligible velocity dispersion after matter–radiation equality; suppresses formation of halos smaller than the free-streaming scale.  
Thermal WDM mass scale mentioned: $$\sim \mathrm{keV}$$.

---

## 7) Decaying dark matter

Slide idea: DM decays sometime between CMB and now; daughter particle gets a velocity “kick,” suppressing small-scale structure.

Decay shown:  
$$  
\chi_1 \to \chi_2 + \gamma  
$$  

### 7.1 Kick derivation (2-body decay in parent rest frame)

Assume parent at rest, photon is massless.

Let the magnitude of momentum of the products be $$p$$ (same for both, opposite directions).

- Photon energy:  
    $$  
    E_\gamma = pc  
    $$
    
- Daughter energy:  
    $$  
    E_2=\sqrt{p^2c^2+m_2^2c^4}  
    $$  
    Energy conservation:  
    $$  
    m_1c^2 = E_2 + E_\gamma  
    $$  
    Substitute:  
    $$  
    m_1c^2=\sqrt{p^2c^2+m_2^2c^4}+pc  
    $$  
    Solve for $$p$$ (standard 2-body result):  
    $$  
    p=\frac{(m_1^2-m_2^2)c}{2m_1}  
    $$  
    Then the daughter’s speed (“kick”) follows from relativistic momentum:  
    $$  
    v_2=\frac{pc^2}{E_2}  
    $$  
    If the mass splitting is small, $$m_1=m_2+\Delta m$$ with $$\Delta m\ll m_1$$, then  
    $$  
    m_1^2-m_2^2=(m_1-m_2)(m_1+m_2)\approx (\Delta m)(2m_1)  
    $$  
    So  
    $$  
    p\approx \Delta m,c  
    $$  
    and the kick is of order  
    $$  
    v_2 \sim \frac{p}{m_2}\approx \frac{\Delta m}{m_2}c  
    $$  
    Interpretation: even a modest fractional mass splitting can inject a non-negligible velocity, increasing free-streaming and suppressing small halos (as stated on the slide).

## 8) Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and the Bullet Cluster

Slide setup: we know DM doesn’t interact strongly with ordinary matter; question is whether DM self-interacts. Bullet Cluster is a key test.

### 8.1 What is observed (from our discussion + slide)

Three components in Bullet Cluster:

- **Blue (lensing)**: total gravitating matter.
    
- **Red (X-ray)**: hot gas (dominant baryonic mass).
    
- **Galaxies**: baryons but collisionless-like tracers.
    

Key inference:

- Lensing mass peaks align with galaxies rather than the slowed gas → DM is largely collisionless (not strongly self-interacting).
    

### 8.2 Interaction rate formula and why constraints are in $$\sigma/m$$

Slide gives:  
$$  
\Gamma \sim n_1 n_2 \sigma v_{\rm rel}  
$$  
and  
$$  
n_2=\frac{\rho}{m_\chi}  
$$  
and constraints expressed in  
$$  
\frac{\sigma}{m}  
$$

#### Derivation of the rate scaling

1. For one “beam” of particles with number density $$n_1$$ moving through a target population with density $$n_2$$:
    

- Each particle sees collision probability per time:  
    $$  
    \text{rate per particle} \sim n_2,\sigma,v_{\rm rel}  
    $$  
    (“targets per volume” × “area” × “speed”).
    

2. Multiply by number of incoming particles per volume $$n_1$$ to get collisions per volume per time:  
    $$  
    \Gamma \sim n_1,(n_2\sigma v_{\rm rel}) = n_1 n_2 \sigma v_{\rm rel}  
    $$  
    This matches the slide’s scaling.
    

#### Derivation of $$n=\rho/m_\chi$$

- Mass density is mass per volume:  
    $$  
    \rho = \frac{\text{total mass}}{\text{volume}}  
    $$
    
- If each particle has mass $$m_\chi$$ and number density is $$n$$ (particles per volume), then total mass per volume is:  
    $$  
    \rho = n,m_\chi  
    $$  
    So:  
    $$  
    n=\frac{\rho}{m_\chi}  
    $$  
    (matches the slide).
    

#### Why we constrain $$\sigma/m_\chi$$ (not $$\sigma$$ alone)

Insert $$n=\rho/m_\chi$$ into the per-particle scattering rate:  
$$  
n\sigma \sim \left(\frac{\rho}{m_\chi}\right)\sigma = \rho\left(\frac{\sigma}{m_\chi}\right)  
$$  
Observations (lensing) give access to mass density $$\rho$$, not particle number density or particle mass separately → the measurable combination is:  
$$  
\frac{\sigma}{m_\chi}  
$$  
as stated.

## 9) Wave / Fuzzy dark matter (FDM)

Slide: if DM is very light, its Compton wavelength can be macroscopic; structure suppressed below that scale; wave interference patterns may appear.

### 9.1 Compton wavelength

Definition:  
$$  
\lambda_C=\frac{h}{mc}  
$$

**Derivation (from photon energy scale):**

1. A photon has energy:  
    $$  
    E_\gamma = \frac{hc}{\lambda}  
    $$
    
2. A particle’s rest energy is:  
    $$  
    E_0 = mc^2  
    $$
    
3. The Compton wavelength is obtained by equating these characteristic energy scales:  
    $$  
    mc^2=\frac{hc}{\lambda_C}  
    $$
    
4. Solve for $$\lambda_C$$:  
    $$  
    \lambda_C=\frac{h}{mc}  
    $$
    

**Meaning of terms:**

- $$h$$: Planck’s constant.
    
- $$m$$: particle mass.
    
- $$c$$: speed of light.
    
- If $$m$$ is extremely small, $$\lambda_C$$ becomes very large → “wave-like” on macroscopic scales (slide statement).
    

### 9.2 Difference vs de Broglie wavelength (from our discussion; exam-useful)

De Broglie wavelength:  
$$  
\lambda_{\rm dB}=\frac{h}{p}  
$$  
For non-relativistic motion $$p\approx mv$$:  
$$  
\lambda_{\rm dB}\approx \frac{h}{mv}  
$$  
Relate to Compton:  
$$  
\lambda_C=\frac{h}{mc}  
$$  
So:  
$$  
\lambda_{\rm dB}\approx \frac{h}{mv}=\frac{c}{v}\frac{h}{mc}=\frac{c}{v}\lambda_C  
$$  
Since typically $$v\ll c$$ in halos, $$\lambda_{\rm dB}$$ can be much larger than $$\lambda_C$$ and is often the scale most directly tied to “fuzzy” interference in galaxies (conceptual takeaway).

### 9.3 FDM must be bosons; soliton core

Slides: fuzzy DM must be bosons, can form a condensate in galaxy cores → soliton core; proposed as a way to address cusp–core.

---

## 10) Tremaine–Gunn bound (fermionic DM)

Slide: if DM is fermions, obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics; phase-space considerations set a lower bound on fermion DM mass; “modern limit” order $$\sim 1,\mathrm{keV}$$.

Conceptual exam sentence:

- “Pauli exclusion limits how densely fermions can be packed in phase space; dense, low-dispersion dwarf halos imply the fermion must be heavy enough (keV-ish) to allow the required phase-space density.”
    

---

## 11) Double Disk Dark Matter (DDDM) and dissipation

Slides: DM could have several components; one subcomponent could be dissipative; but not all DM can be dissipative like baryons.

### 11.1 What “dissipative” means and why it matters

Slide definition: dissipative = system loses energy after interactions (e.g., radiation), allowing collapse.

- Baryons dissipate by radiating; hence they cool, collapse, form disks and stars.
    
- Rotation curves show DM remains extended in a halo → therefore DM cannot be as dissipative as baryons (for the dominant component).
    

### 11.2 Thin dark disk and Solar System crossings (speculative application)

Slide: a thin dark disk could add gravitational pull that perturbs comets/asteroids and could enhance extinction-event probability.

---

## 12) One-page mental map (rapid recall)

- **CDM**: cold, collisionless → hierarchical (bottom-up) structure.
    
- **Hot DM (neutrino-like)**: fast → wipes small scales → top-down → disagrees with observed structure.
    
- **WDM (~keV)**: partial suppression of small scales (free streaming).
    
- **Decaying DM**: kick velocity to daughters → suppress small halos.
    
- **SIDM**: self-scattering reshapes dense cores; Bullet Cluster constrains $$\sigma/m$$.
    
- **FDM/Wave DM**: ultra-light bosons → wave effects, interference, soliton core.
    
- **DDDM**: small dissipative subcomponent could form a disk; but most DM must remain non-dissipative to keep a halo.
