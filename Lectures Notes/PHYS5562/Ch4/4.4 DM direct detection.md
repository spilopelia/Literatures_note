# Dark Matter Direct Detection & Solar WIMP Search (Exam Revision Note)

## 0. Big picture: WIMP hypothesis → direct + indirect detection

- WIMP-like dark matter typically implies **both**:
    
    - elastic scattering on matter (direct detection), and
        
    - annihilation into SM particles (indirect detection).
        
- Direct detection process (schematic):  
    $$  
    \chi + f \to f + \chi  
    $$  
    with detector underground waiting for rare interactions.
    
- Indirect detection / freezeout-motivated annihilation (schematic):  
    $$  
    \chi\chi \to \bar f f  
    $$

## 1. Neutrino coherent scattering (CEvNS) and why it matters (background / “neutrino floor” context)

### 1.1 Coherence idea and scaling

When momentum transfer is small compared to nuclear size, the neutrino “sees” the whole nucleus.

- Coherent amplitude scales with nucleon number:  
    $$  
    \langle \nu' N'|M|\nu N\rangle \propto N  
    $$  
    
- Cross section is probability (\propto) amplitude squared:  
    $$  
    \sigma \propto |\langle \nu' N'|M|\nu N\rangle|^2 \propto N^2  
    $$  
    
- Incoherent scattering (no phase alignment across nucleons) scales instead like:  
    $$  
    \sigma \propto N  
    $$  
    

### 1.2 Neutrino floor statement

As detectors improve, they will see neutrino neutral-current events:  
$$  
\nu + N \to \nu + N  
$$  
and it becomes difficult to distinguish DM and neutrino events.

## 2. Direct detection interaction rate: build-up from “probability in a path length”

### 2.1 Start from the basic microscopic probability (our discussion)

Consider a DM particle traversing material with target number density (n_t). For a thin path segment (dL), the probability of one interaction is

$$  
dP_{\rm int} = n_t,\sigma,dL  
$$

**Meaning of each term**

- (n_t): number of target nuclei per unit volume.
    
- (\sigma): interaction cross section (effective area).
    
- (dL): infinitesimal distance traveled in the material.
    

This is the “thin slab” approximation: treat targets as independent and the interaction probability as proportional to the number of targets encountered in (dL).

### 2.2 Exponential attenuation and thin/thick limits (our discussion)

Let (P_0(L)) be survival probability (no interaction after distance (L)). In an extra (dL),  
$$  
P_0(L+dL)=P_0(L)\left(1-n_t\sigma,dL\right)  
$$  
Subtract (P_0(L)), divide by (dL), and take (dL\to 0):  
$$  
\frac{dP_0}{dL}=-n_t\sigma,P_0  
$$  
Solve:  
$$  
P_0(L)=e^{-n_t\sigma L}  
$$  
So probability of at least one interaction is  
$$  
P_{\ge 1}(L)=1-P_0(L)=1-e^{-n_t\sigma L}  
$$

Define optical depth  
$$  
\tau \equiv n_t\sigma L  
$$

- **Thin limit** (single-scatter / linear regime):  
    $$  
    \tau \ll 1  
    $$  
    Use the exponential expansion (see below):  
    $$  
    1-e^{-\tau}\simeq \tau  
    $$  
    Hence  
    $$  
    P_{\ge 1}(L)\simeq n_t\sigma L  
    $$
    
- **Thick limit** (saturation / multi-scatter likely):  
    $$  
    \tau \gg 1  
    $$  
    Then  
    $$  
    P_{\ge 1}(L)=1-e^{-\tau}\to 1  
    $$
    

Also define mean free path:  
$$  
\lambda \equiv \frac{1}{n_t\sigma}  
$$  
Thin means (L\ll \lambda), thick means (L\gg \lambda).

### 2.3 Exponential expansion used (our discussion)

Taylor-expand around (\tau=0):  
$$  
e^{-\tau}=1-\tau+\frac{\tau^2}{2!}-\frac{\tau^3}{3!}+\cdots  
$$  
Then  
$$  
1-e^{-\tau}=\tau-\frac{\tau^2}{2!}+\frac{\tau^3}{3!}-\cdots  
$$  
So for (\tau\ll 1), keep leading term:  
$$  
1-e^{-\tau}\simeq \tau  
$$

## 3. Macroscopic rate in a detector: number density × flux × cross section

### 3.1 Slide-level interaction rate (no recoil yet)

The lecture states the scaling  
$$  
R \sim n_\chi,n_t,\sigma,v,dV  
$$  
and explains it as  
“[DM number density] × [target number density] × [cross section] × [DM velocity] × [detector volume]”.

**Derivation (connect to probability result)**

- DM number density: (n_\chi)
    
- For DM speed (v), flux through targets is (n_\chi v)
    
- Number of targets in volume element (dV) is (n_t dV)
    
- Interaction probability per unit time for one DM particle is (n_t\sigma v) (from (dL=vdt))  
    Thus interactions per time in (dV):  
    $$  
    dR = (n_\chi,dV),(n_t\sigma v)  
    $$  
    Rearrange:  
    $$  
    dR \sim n_\chi,n_t,\sigma,v,dV  
    $$
    

### 3.2 Including a velocity distribution (slide)

The lecture adds velocity distribution:  
$$  
R \sim n_\chi,n_t,\sigma(vf),dv,dV  
$$  

**Meaning**

- (f(v),dv): probability that DM has speed in ([v,v+dv])
    
- (\sigma(v)): cross section can depend on (v)
    
- Multiply by (v): flux weighting
    

---

## 4. Recoil spectrum: differential rate (dR/dE_{nr})

### 4.1 Why recoil energy matters (slide)

To “see the interaction”, specify what happens after interaction. Simplest is elastic scattering: nucleus recoils, and recoil energy (E_{nr}) is what detectors measure; detectors have thresholds.

### 4.2 Differential interaction rate (slide)

# The lecture writes  
$$  
\frac{dR}{dE_{nr}}

n_\chi\left(\int n_t,dV\right)  
\frac{d\sigma}{dE_{nr}},(v f,dv),  
\qquad v_{\min}  
$$  
with (v_{\min}) stated as the minimum DM velocity to trigger the detector.

**Explain each piece**

- (n_\chi): incoming DM number density.
    
- (\int n_t,dV): total number of target nuclei in the detector.
    
- (\frac{d\sigma}{dE_{nr}}): probability density for producing recoil (E_{nr}) given a DM with speed (v).
    
- (v f(v),dv): flux-weighted fraction of DM speeds.
    
- (v_{\min}(E_{nr})): kinematic threshold speed to produce a recoil (E_{nr}) (and/or above detector threshold).
    

### 4.3 Converting (\int n_t dV) into detector mass

If the detector has mass (M) and target nucleus mass (m_N), then the number of nuclei is  
$$  
\int n_t,dV = \frac{M}{m_N}  
$$  
because total mass is (number of nuclei) × (mass per nucleus).

Also relate DM number density to local DM mass density (\rho_0):  
$$  
n_\chi = \frac{\rho_0}{m_\chi}  
$$  
so the common prefactor becomes  
$$  
n_\chi\left(\int n_t,dV\right)=\frac{\rho_0,M}{m_\chi,m_N}  
$$

### 4.4 Kinematic derivation of (v_{\min}(E_{nr}))

For elastic scattering, maximum recoil at speed (v) is  
$$  
E_{nr}^{\max}(v)=\frac{2\mu_{\chi N}^2}{m_N}v^2  
$$  
where reduced mass  
$$  
\mu_{\chi N}=\frac{m_\chi m_N}{m_\chi+m_N}  
$$  
To get a recoil (E_{nr}), require (E_{nr}\le E_{nr}^{\max}(v)):  
$$  
E_{nr}\le \frac{2\mu_{\chi N}^2}{m_N}v^2  
$$  
Solve for (v):  
$$  
v^2 \ge \frac{m_N E_{nr}}{2\mu_{\chi N}^2}  
$$  
Therefore  
$$  
v_{\min}(E_{nr})=\sqrt{\frac{m_N E_{nr}}{2\mu_{\chi N}^2}}  
$$

## 5. Velocity distribution and why the recoil spectrum is “roughly exponential”

### 5.1 Standard Halo Model assumption (slide)

At the solar system, assume a smooth halo (e.g. NFW) and a Maxwellian velocity distribution.

A common simplified speed distribution form is:  
$$  
f(v)\propto v^2 e^{-v^2/v_0^2}  
$$  
(normalization omitted here; (v_0) is a characteristic halo speed).

### 5.2 Halo integral and exponential dependence (keep this result for exam)

Assume (model-dependent) that for contact-like scattering the differential cross section behaves as  
$$  
\frac{d\sigma}{dE_{nr}}\propto \frac{1}{v^2},F^2(E_{nr})  
$$  
(**You requested to drop the derivation of** (d\sigma/dE_{nr}); this is the standard input.)

Plug into the master formula (schematically):  
$$  
\frac{dR}{dE_{nr}} \propto \int_{v_{\min}}^\infty v f(v),\frac{1}{v^2},F^2(E_{nr}),dv  
$$  
Since (F^2(E_{nr})) does not depend on (v), pull it out:  
$$  
\frac{dR}{dE_{nr}} \propto F^2(E_{nr})\int_{v_{\min}}^\infty \frac{f(v)}{v},dv  
$$  
Define the “halo integral”  
$$  
\eta(v_{\min})\equiv \int_{v_{\min}}^\infty \frac{f(v)}{v},dv  
$$  
So  
$$  
\frac{dR}{dE_{nr}} \propto F^2(E_{nr}),\eta(v_{\min})  
$$

Now insert Maxwellian-like (f(v)\propto v^2 e^{-v^2/v_0^2}):  
$$  
\eta(v_{\min}) \propto \int_{v_{\min}}^\infty v,e^{-v^2/v_0^2},dv  
$$  
Let  
$$  
u=\frac{v^2}{v_0^2}  
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad  
du=\frac{2v}{v_0^2}dv  
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad  
v,dv=\frac{v_0^2}{2},du  
$$  
Then  
$$  
\eta(v_{\min}) \propto \frac{v_0^2}{2}\int_{u_{\min}}^\infty e^{-u},du  
$$  
with  
$$  
u_{\min}=\frac{v_{\min}^2}{v_0^2}  
$$  
Evaluate the exponential tail integral:  
$$  
\int_{u_{\min}}^\infty e^{-u},du = e^{-u_{\min}}  
$$  
So  
$$  
\eta(v_{\min}) \propto e^{-v_{\min}^2/v_0^2}  
$$

Finally use the kinematic relation  
$$  
v_{\min}^2=\frac{m_N E_{nr}}{2\mu_{\chi N}^2}  
$$  
to get  
$$  
\eta(v_{\min})\propto \exp!\left(-\frac{m_N E_{nr}}{2\mu_{\chi N}^2 v_0^2}\right)  
$$  
Thus the recoil spectrum has the “roughly exponential” form:  
$$  
\frac{dR}{dE_{nr}} \propto \exp!\left(-\frac{m_N E_{nr}}{2\mu_{\chi N}^2 v_0^2}\right),F^2(E_{nr})  
$$

**Connection to the slide’s qualitative statement**: the event rate relies on the high-velocity tail and is “~ exponential function”.

> Note from our discussion: depending on how the lecture defines the energy scale (E_0), the exponential may be written with different-looking mass factors. The physically robust statement is that the exponential comes from (e^{-v_{\min}^2/v_0^2}), and (v_{\min}^2\propto E_{nr}).

## 6. SI vs SD scattering (what changes in the rate normalization)

The lecture distinguishes two nonrelativistic interaction types:

- **Spin-independent (SI)**: gets coherent enhancement:  
    $$  
    \sigma_{\rm SI}\propto A^2  
    $$
    
- **Spin-dependent (SD)**: requires nucleus with non-zero spin and does not get the same coherent enhancement.
    

---

## 7. Typical recoil-energy scale (why detectors must be sensitive)

Lecture estimate: incoming DM momentum is about (m_\chi v), and if transferred to nucleus the recoil energy scale is roughly  
$$  
E_r \sim \frac{(m_\chi v)^2}{m_N}  
$$  
With typical halo speed  
$$  
v \sim 10^{-3}c  
$$  
  
this can give very small (E_r) (order eV–keV depending on masses), motivating extremely sensitive detectors.

---

## 8. Null detections, limits, and hypotheses (include our discussion)

### 8.1 Null detection (direct detection context)

A non-detection means no statistically significant signal above background in the recoil data; it sets an upper bound on interaction strength. The lecture states:  
“Non detection sets a limit on the dark matter nucleon interaction cross section.”

### 8.2 “DM hypothesis” (how to interpret limits)

In hypothesis-testing language (our discussion):

- Background-only hypothesis:  
    $$  
    H_0:\ \text{no DM signal}  
    $$
    
- DM signal hypothesis:  
    $$  
    H_1:\ \text{background} + \text{DM signal}  
    $$  
    A “DM signal” requires assuming a model: (m_\chi), (\sigma_{\chi N}), (\rho_0), (f(v)), interaction type (SI/SD), etc. Limits exclude regions of this model parameter space.
    

### 8.3 Consistency tension example (lecture)

DAMA’s claim is described as inconsistent with null detections of other detectors.

---

## 9. Search for dark matter from the Sun (solar WIMP capture → neutrinos)

### 9.1 Why the Sun can be a “DM detector”

Lecture motivation: neutrino channels are difficult, but if DM is WIMP it has both scattering and annihilation.

Conceptual steps (lecture “Sun – DM detector”):

1. DM first scatters with the Sun
    
2. Loses energy and becomes gravitationally bound (captured)
    
3. Accumulates in the center
    
4. Annihilates
    
5. Neutrinos escape and can be detected
    

### 9.2 Evolution equation (lecture)

Let (N(t)) be the number of captured DM particles in the Sun. The capture–annihilation balance is  
$$  
\frac{dN}{dt}=C-AN^2  
$$

**Meaning of each term (lecture)**

- (N): amount of DM in the Sun.
    
- (C): capture term; does not depend on (N).
    
- (AN^2): annihilation depletion; proportional to (N^2) because annihilation requires two DM particles.
    

### 9.3 Why annihilation event rate is (\tfrac{1}{2}AN^2) (lecture logic)

Each annihilation event consumes two DM particles. If annihilation _events_ occur at rate (\Gamma_A), then particle number decreases as  
$$  
\left.\frac{dN}{dt}\right|_{\rm ann}=-2\Gamma_A  
$$  
But the evolution equation says  
$$  
\left.\frac{dN}{dt}\right|_{\rm ann}=-AN^2  
$$  
Equate them:  
$$  
-2\Gamma_A = -AN^2  
$$  
Therefore  
$$  
\Gamma_A=\frac{1}{2}AN^2  
$$  
which matches the lecture statement that the annihilation rate for signal computation uses the (\tfrac{1}{2}) factor.

### 9.4 Equilibrium condition (lecture)

At late times the system can reach equilibrium:  
$$  
\frac{dN}{dt}\to 0  
$$  
so  
$$  
0=C-AN^2  
\quad\Rightarrow\quad  
N_0=\sqrt{\frac{C}{A}}  
$$  

Then the annihilation event rate becomes  
$$  
\Gamma_A=\frac{1}{2}A N_0^2  
=\frac{1}{2}A\left(\frac{C}{A}\right)  
=\frac{1}{2}C  
$$  

### 9.5 Full time-dependent solution without using the arctanh integral (requested)

# Define  
$$  
N_0\equiv \sqrt{\frac{C}{A}}  
$$  
Try the form  
$$  
N(t)=N_0,\tanh\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)  
$$  
Compute the derivative:  
$$  
\frac{dN}{dt}

# N_0\cdot \frac{1}{\tau},\operatorname{sech}^2\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)  
$$  
Compute RHS of evolution equation:  
$$  
C-AN^2

# C-A N_0^2\tanh^2\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)  
$$  
But since (A N_0^2 = A(C/A)=C),  
$$  
C-AN^2

# C-C\tanh^2\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)

C,\operatorname{sech}^2\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)  
$$  
So the equation (\frac{dN}{dt}=C-AN^2) is satisfied provided  
$$  
\frac{N_0}{\tau}=C  
$$  
Solve for (\tau):  
$$  
\tau=\frac{N_0}{C}  
=\frac{\sqrt{C/A}}{C}  
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{CA}}  
$$  
Therefore the solution is  
$$  
N(t)=\sqrt{\frac{C}{A}};\tanh!\left(\sqrt{CA},t\right)  
$$  
and the annihilation event rate is  
$$  
\Gamma_A(t)=\frac{1}{2}AN(t)^2  
=\frac{C}{2}\tanh^2!\left(\sqrt{CA},t\right)  
$$  
Equilibrium corresponds to (t\gg \tau\Rightarrow \tanh(\sqrt{CA}t)\to 1), giving (\Gamma_A\to C/2), consistent with the lecture.

### 9.6 What solar DM searches constrain (lecture)

Lecture conclusion:

- Solar DM search mainly tests the **capture** process → thus constrains DM–nucleon cross section.
    
- The annihilation part and channel assumptions (only neutrino observable) affect equilibrium and interpretation.

## 10. Extra: annual modulation & boosted DM (context)

### 10.1 Annual modulation (lecture)

Earth orbits the Sun; the Sun moves through the halo. When Earth moves along with the Sun, the average DM speed is higher → event rate increases.

### 10.2 Cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (lecture)

If detection is speed-limited, cosmic rays can scatter on DM and boost it to relativistic speeds, potentially overcoming detector thresholds and enabling neutrino-detector searches.
