### 0.1 Scale factor, temperature, and entropy conservation
In an expanding Universe with scale factor \(a(t)\), a comoving volume grows as
$$
V \propto a^3.
$$

For a thermal bath, define the **entropy density** \(s\). The **comoving entropy** is
$$
S \equiv s a^3.
$$
If the expansion is adiabatic (no net entropy production in the plasma), then
$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{d(sa^3)}{dt}=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
sa^3=\text{const}.
$$

For a relativistic plasma,
$$
s = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}\,g_{*s}(T)\,T^3,
$$
where \(g_{*s}(T)\) is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom contributing to entropy.

Plug into \(sa^3=\) const:
$$
\left[\frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*s}(T)T^3\right]a^3=\text{const}
\;\Rightarrow\;
g_{*s}(T)\,T^3\,a^3=\text{const}.
$$

So the temperature scales as
$$
T \propto g_{*s}(T)^{-1/3}\,a^{-1}.
$$
If \(g_{*s}\) is roughly constant over some era, this becomes the usual
$$
T\propto a^{-1}.
$$

### 0.2 Why “power of \(T\)” corresponds to “power of \(a\)”
If a quantity scales like \(T^n\), and \(T\propto a^{-1}\) (with constant \(g_{*s}\)), then
$$
T^n \propto a^{-n}.
$$
Example (radiation energy density below):
$$
\rho_{\rm rad}\propto T^4 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \rho_{\rm rad}\propto a^{-4}.
$$

### 0.3 Energy-density scaling law \( \rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)} \)
Start from local energy conservation in FRW:
$$
\dot\rho + 3H(\rho+P)=0,
$$
where
$$
H\equiv \frac{\dot a}{a}.
$$
Assume an equation of state
$$
w \equiv \frac{P}{\rho}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
P=w\rho.
$$
Insert \(P=w\rho\):
$$
\dot\rho + 3H\rho(1+w)=0.
$$
Divide by \(\rho\):
$$
\frac{\dot\rho}{\rho} = -3(1+w)H = -3(1+w)\frac{\dot a}{a}.
$$
Rewrite as differentials:
$$
d\ln\rho = -3(1+w)\,d\ln a.
$$
Integrate:
$$
\ln\rho = -3(1+w)\ln a + \text{const}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}.
$$
Special cases:
- matter \(w=0\): \(\rho\propto a^{-3}\)
- radiation \(w=\frac13\): \(\rho\propto a^{-4}\)
- vacuum \(w=-1\): \(\rho=\) constant

### 0.4 Example: electron–positron annihilation and why it matters
When the temperature drops below the electron mass, electrons and positrons annihilate mainly into photons.
- Photons stay in equilibrium with the \(e^\pm\) plasma.
- Neutrinos have already decoupled (they stop interacting efficiently), so they **do not** get reheated by \(e^\pm\) annihilation.

Entropy conservation lets you derive the standard temperature ratio.

Before annihilation (photon + \(e^\pm\) in the EM plasma):
$$
g_{*s,\rm before} = 2 + \frac{7}{8}\times 4 = 2 + 3.5 = 5.5.
$$
After annihilation (only photons in the EM plasma):
$$
g_{*s,\rm after} = 2.
$$

Apply \(g_{*s}T^3a^3=\) const to the **EM plasma**:
$$
g_{*s,\rm before}T_{\gamma,\rm before}^3a^3
=
g_{*s,\rm after}T_{\gamma,\rm after}^3a^3.
$$
Cancel \(a^3\):
$$
g_{*s,\rm before}T_{\gamma,\rm before}^3
=
g_{*s,\rm after}T_{\gamma,\rm after}^3.
$$
Thus
$$
T_{\gamma,\rm after}
=
\left(\frac{g_{*s,\rm before}}{g_{*s,\rm after}}\right)^{1/3}
T_{\gamma,\rm before}
=
\left(\frac{5.5}{2}\right)^{1/3}T_{\gamma,\rm before}.
$$

Neutrinos are decoupled, so they just cool as \(T_\nu\propto a^{-1}\) with **no** reheating, i.e.
$$
T_{\nu,\rm after}=T_{\nu,\rm before}\left(\frac{a_{\rm before}}{a_{\rm after}}\right).
$$
At the moment just before annihilation, \(T_{\nu,\rm before}=T_{\gamma,\rm before}\). Combine with the photon reheating to get
$$
\frac{T_{\nu,\rm after}}{T_{\gamma,\rm after}}=\left(\frac{4}{11}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
This kind of “entropy dump into photons” is what your WIMP slide is analogizing when it says reactions become one-sided once \(T<m\).

## 1. WIMPs

### 1.1 Basic assumption: 2-to-2 interactions with SM
We assume processes like
$$
\chi\chi \leftrightarrow f\bar f,
$$
so at **high temperature**
$$
T \gg m_\chi,
$$
the forward and backward reactions keep \(\chi\) in thermal equilibrium.

### 1.2 Energy density in equilibrium (relativistic limit)
General formula for energy density:
$$
\rho = g\int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,E\,f(E),
$$
where
- \(g\) = internal degrees of freedom,
- \(E=\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\),
- \(f(E)\) = distribution function.

For relativistic species (\(m\ll T\)), take \(E\simeq p\).

#### Bosons (Bose–Einstein)
$$
f_{\rm BE}(p)=\frac{1}{e^{p/T}-1}.
$$
Compute:
$$
\rho_{\rm BE}
=
g\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,p\,\frac{1}{e^{p/T}-1}.
$$
Use spherical momentum coordinates \(d^3p=4\pi p^2dp\):
$$
\rho_{\rm BE}
=
g\int_0^\infty \frac{4\pi p^2dp}{(2\pi)^3}\,p\,\frac{1}{e^{p/T}-1}
=
\frac{g}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty dp\,\frac{p^3}{e^{p/T}-1}.
$$
Change variables \(x\equiv p/T\), so \(p=Tx\), \(dp=Tdx\):
$$
\rho_{\rm BE}
=
\frac{g}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty Tdx\,\frac{(Tx)^3}{e^{x}-1}
=
\frac{gT^4}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty dx\,\frac{x^3}{e^{x}-1}.
$$
Use the standard integral
$$
\int_0^\infty dx\,\frac{x^3}{e^{x}-1}=\frac{\pi^4}{15}.
$$
Therefore
$$
\rho_{\rm BE}=\frac{gT^4}{2\pi^2}\cdot\frac{\pi^4}{15}
=
g\frac{\pi^2}{30}T^4.
$$

#### Fermions (Fermi–Dirac)
$$
f_{\rm FD}(p)=\frac{1}{e^{p/T}+1}.
$$
Same steps give
$$
\rho_{\rm FD}
=
\frac{gT^4}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty dx\,\frac{x^3}{e^{x}+1}.
$$
And the standard identity
$$
\int_0^\infty dx\,\frac{x^3}{e^{x}+1}=\frac{7}{8}\frac{\pi^4}{15}.
$$
So
$$
\rho_{\rm FD}
=
\frac{7}{8}\,g\frac{\pi^2}{30}T^4.
$$

### 1.3 Number density “regimes” and whether the distribution changes
Yes: as the Universe cools relative to the particle mass, the **equilibrium distribution** changes.

#### Regime A: relativistic equilibrium \(T\gg m_\chi\)
Momentum distribution is BE/FD with \(E\simeq p\). The number density is
$$
n = g\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,f(p).
$$
Doing the same change of variables gives the scaling
$$
n_{\rm rel}\propto T^3.
$$
(Exact constants involve \(\zeta(3)\), and fermions get a factor \(3/4\) vs bosons.)

#### Regime B: non-relativistic equilibrium \(T\ll m_\chi\)
Now \(E\simeq m_\chi + \frac{p^2}{2m_\chi}\) and the distribution becomes approximately Maxwell–Boltzmann:
$$
f(p)\approx e^{-E/T}=e^{-m_\chi/T}\,e^{-p^2/(2m_\chi T)}.
$$
Plug into the number density integral:
$$
n_{\rm eq}
=
g\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,e^{-m_\chi/T}\,e^{-p^2/(2m_\chi T)}
=
g\,e^{-m_\chi/T}\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\,e^{-p^2/(2m_\chi T)}.
$$
Use the Gaussian integral
$$
\int d^3p\,e^{-\alpha p^2}=\left(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}\right)^{3/2},
\quad
\alpha=\frac{1}{2m_\chi T}.
$$
So
$$
\int d^3p\,e^{-p^2/(2m_\chi T)}=(2\pi m_\chi T)^{3/2}.
$$
Therefore
$$
n_{\rm eq}
=
g\,e^{-m_\chi/T}\frac{(2\pi m_\chi T)^{3/2}}{(2\pi)^3}
=
g\left(\frac{m_\chi T}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2}e^{-m_\chi/T}.
$$
Key point: when \(T<m_\chi\), equilibrium abundance plummets exponentially.

#### Regime C: after freeze-out (out of equilibrium)
After interactions become too slow, the **comoving** number stays approximately constant:
$$
N \equiv n a^3 \approx \text{const}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
n\propto a^{-3}.
$$
So the **shape** of the distribution stops being thermal, and the abundance simply dilutes with expansion (plus small residual annihilations right after freeze-out).

### 1.4 Boltzmann equation for WIMP number density
The slide’s evolution equation is
$$
\frac{dn}{dt}+3Hn = \langle\sigma v\rangle\left(n_{\rm eq}^2-n^2\right).
$$

**Derivation of the \(3Hn\) term (dilution):**  
Define total number in a comoving volume:
$$
N \equiv n a^3.
$$
Differentiate:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt}=\frac{d(na^3)}{dt}=a^3\frac{dn}{dt}+3a^2\dot a\,n
=a^3\left(\frac{dn}{dt}+3\frac{\dot a}{a}n\right)
=a^3\left(\frac{dn}{dt}+3Hn\right).
$$
So
$$
\frac{dn}{dt}+3Hn=\frac{1}{a^3}\frac{d(na^3)}{dt}.
$$
The left-hand side is “change in comoving number density”.

**Derivation of the collision term:**  
For annihilation \(\chi\chi\to f\bar f\), the annihilation rate per volume is proportional to
$$
(\text{of pairs per volume})\times (\text{rate per pair})
\;\propto\;
n^2\langle\sigma v\rangle.
$$
Detailed balance says in equilibrium the net change is zero, so the simplest form that vanishes when \(n=n_{\rm eq}\) is
$$
\left(\frac{d n}{dt}\right)_{\rm coll}
=
-\langle\sigma v\rangle\left(n^2-n_{\rm eq}^2\right)
=
\langle\sigma v\rangle\left(n_{\rm eq}^2-n^2\right).
$$
Combine with the dilution piece to get the full equation.

### 1.5 Interaction rate vs Hubble rate and “freeze-out”
Be careful with two related “rates”:

- **Per-particle annihilation rate**
$$
\Gamma_{\rm ann} \sim n\langle\sigma v\rangle.
$$
- **Per-volume annihilation rate**
$$
(\text{annihilations per volume per time})\sim n^2\langle\sigma v\rangle.
$$

Freeze-out happens when the interaction can no longer keep up with expansion:
$$
\Gamma_{\rm ann} \lesssim H.
$$

Two limits where the RHS is effectively zero:
1) Strong interaction keeps equilibrium:
$$
n \to n_{\rm eq}.
$$
2) Interaction becomes negligible:
$$
\Gamma_{\rm ann}\ll H \quad\Rightarrow\quad \text{freeze-out}.
$$

### 1.6 WIMP miracle: why \(\langle\sigma v\rangle\) sets today’s abundance
A convenient variable is the yield
$$
Y\equiv \frac{n}{s},
$$
because \(s a^3\) is (approximately) conserved, so dilution is factored out.

Rewrite the Boltzmann equation in terms of \(Y\) and
$$
x \equiv \frac{m_\chi}{T}.
$$
The standard manipulation gives an equation schematically of the form
$$
\frac{dY}{dx}\sim -\frac{s\langle\sigma v\rangle}{Hx}\left(Y^2-Y_{\rm eq}^2\right).
$$
After freeze-out \(Y\gg Y_{\rm eq}\), so
$$
\frac{dY}{dx}\sim -\frac{s\langle\sigma v\rangle}{Hx}Y^2.
$$
Integrating this approximately yields
$$
Y_\infty \sim \frac{H}{s\langle\sigma v\rangle}\Bigg|_{x\sim x_f}.
$$
Since \(H\propto T^2/M_{\rm Pl}\) in radiation domination and \(s\propto T^3\),
$$
\frac{H}{s}\propto \frac{T^2}{T^3}\propto \frac{1}{T}\propto \frac{x}{m_\chi}.
$$
So \(Y_\infty\) scales roughly like
$$
Y_\infty \propto \frac{1}{m_\chi\langle\sigma v\rangle}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\rho_\chi \sim m_\chi n \sim m_\chi (sY_\infty) \propto \frac{1}{\langle\sigma v\rangle}.
$$
That is the key “miracle”: the relic density depends mainly on the annihilation cross section, only weakly on the mass.

A commonly quoted benchmark is
$$
\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 3\times 10^{-26}\,\text{cm}^3/\text{s}.
$$

### 1.7 From our discussion
- Are we assuming WIMPs are relativistic?  
  Early on, yes:
  $$T\gg m_\chi.$$
  But freeze-out happens when they become non-relativistic:
  $$T\lesssim m_\chi,$$
  and from then on they behave as cold matter (comoving number nearly fixed; energy dominated by rest mass).

## 2. Motivation: why new physics often predicts a WIMP-like particle

### 2.1 Hierarchy problem in one equation
Quantum loops correct the Higgs mass parameter. A generic quadratically divergent estimate is
$$
\delta m_H^2 \sim \frac{c}{16\pi^2}\,\Lambda^2,
$$
where
- \(\Lambda\) is the cutoff scale (up to where the SM is valid),
- \(c\) is a combination of couplings and signs from different loops.

If \(\Lambda\) is extremely large (e.g. Planck scale), \(\delta m_H^2\) is huge compared to \(m_H^2\sim (100\,\text{GeV})^2\), so getting the observed Higgs mass requires unnatural fine-tuning.

### 2.2 Supersymmetry idea (and a DM candidate)
Supersymmetry pairs each SM particle with a superpartner of different spin.
Fermion loops and boson loops contribute with opposite signs hinting at cancellations:
$$
\delta m_H^2(\text{fermion}) + \delta m_H^2(\text{boson}) \approx 0
$$
in the supersymmetric limit.

If an additional symmetry makes the lightest superpartner stable, it can be a dark matter candidate (often WIMP-like).

#### From our discussion
- “Isn’t the Higgs also spin 0?”  
  Yes: the Higgs is a spin-0 scalar.  
  The axion is also spin-0, but it is typically a **pseudo-scalar** and (for QCD axion) extremely light and extremely weakly coupled; Higgs is heavy (\(\sim 125\) GeV) and couples strongly to SM via electroweak symmetry breaking.

### 2.3 Large extra dimensions idea
If there are extra spatial dimensions of size \(R\), gravity can look different at short distances, which can effectively lower the fundamental gravity scale and address the hierarchy problem. New states (e.g. Kaluza–Klein modes) can appear and some can behave like WIMP candidates.

---

## 3. Axions

### 3.1 Why axions were invented: the strong CP problem
QCD allows a CP-violating term (often written as a \(\theta\)-term). If \(\bar\theta\neq 0\), it induces a neutron electric dipole moment \(d_n\).
Experiments show \(d_n\) is extremely small, implying \(\bar\theta\) is tiny—this looks “not natural”.

Axions arise when you introduce a new symmetry (Peccei–Quinn) that makes \(\bar\theta\) dynamical and relax it toward zero.

### 3.2 Axions as dark matter: thermal vs non-thermal

#### Thermal production (heavy axions)
If axions are heavy enough and interact enough, they can be produced in the hot plasma early.
“Produced early” does not automatically mean “hot today”: if they become non-relativistic sufficiently early, they can behave as cold/warm matter.

#### Non-thermal production: misalignment mechanism
Treat the axion as a classical homogeneous field \(a(t)\) (good when occupation number is huge).
Define
$$
a(t) \equiv f_a\,\theta(t),
$$
where \(f_a\) is the axion scale and \(\theta\) is an angle-like field variable.

For small \(\theta\), the potential is approximately harmonic:
$$
V(\theta)\simeq \frac12 m_a^2 f_a^2 \theta^2.
$$

The equation of motion in an expanding Universe is
$$
\ddot a + 3H\dot a + \frac{\partial V}{\partial a}=0.
$$
Using \(a=f_a\theta\) and \(V\simeq \frac12 m_a^2 a^2\):
$$
\ddot a + 3H\dot a + m_a^2 a = 0
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
\ddot\theta + 3H\dot\theta + m_a^2 \theta=0.
$$

Now compare \(H\) to \(m_a\):

- **Frozen regime**
$$
H\gg m_a.
$$
Then the “friction” term dominates and \(\theta\) barely moves (field is stuck near its initial value \(\theta_i\)).

- **Onset of oscillations**
$$
H \sim m_a.
$$
The field starts rolling and oscillating.

- **Oscillatory regime**
$$
H\ll m_a.
$$
Solution is approximately a damped oscillator. The energy density in coherent oscillations behaves like non-relativistic matter.

**Why oscillations behave like matter:**  
Energy density:
$$
\rho_a = \frac12\dot a^2 + \frac12 m_a^2 a^2.
$$
For a harmonic oscillator, time-average gives equipartition:
$$
\langle \dot a^2\rangle = m_a^2\langle a^2\rangle
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\langle\rho_a\rangle = m_a^2\langle a^2\rangle.
$$
One can show the oscillation amplitude decays like
$$
a_{\rm amp}\propto a^{-3/2}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\rho_a \propto a_{\rm amp}^2 \propto a^{-3}.
$$
So axion misalignment produces **cold, collisionless** dark matter.

### 3.3 Searching for axions
- Without assuming axions are all of DM: solar axion searches (e.g. CAST concept).
- If axions are DM: haloscopes, where axions from the halo convert to photons in a resonant cavity in a magnetic field.

## 4. Sterile neutrinos

### 4.1 What “sterile” means
Active neutrinos interact via weak interactions.
A “right-handed” (sterile) neutrino does not couple to SM gauge bosons, but can mix with active neutrinos.
A mass eigenstate that is mostly sterile can be a DM candidate, and heavy sterile neutrinos can also help with baryogenesis ideas (e.g. leptogenesis).

### 4.2 Freeze-in picture (never in equilibrium)
Active neutrinos in the early Universe are in thermal equilibrium before decoupling. If the sterile state mixes slightly, then each active-neutrino interaction has a small chance to “produce” a sterile neutrino.

The slide writes a phase-space production equation
$$
\frac{d f_s}{dt}=\frac12\langle P\rangle\,\Gamma\, f_a,
$$
where
- \(f_s\) = sterile neutrino distribution function,
- \(f_a\) = active neutrino distribution function (thermal while coupled),
- \(\Gamma\) = interaction rate in the plasma,
- \(\langle P\rangle\) = average conversion probability per interaction.

**Why this structure makes sense:**  
In a short time \(dt\), an active neutrino experiences \(\Gamma\,dt\) interactions on average.
Each interaction converts with probability \(\langle P\rangle\).
So the fraction converted into sterile per time is \(\langle P\rangle\Gamma\), acting on the available active population \(f_a\). The factor \(1/2\) depends on detailed coherence/averaging conventions.

Production shuts off once the active neutrinos decouple and \(\Gamma\) becomes too small.

### 4.3 Dodelson–Widrow vs Shi–Fuller
- **Dodelson–Widrow (non-resonant):** production via small mixing in a thermal bath; typically gives keV sterile neutrinos and can be warm DM.
- **Shi–Fuller (resonant):** a lepton asymmetry provides a matter potential that can induce a resonance and enhance production even for smaller vacuum mixing angles.

### 4.4 Comparison to the MSW effect in the Sun
**Common physics:** both are “mixing in matter”. Matter modifies the effective Hamiltonian and thus the effective mixing angle.

A standard two-flavour matter-mixing expression is
$$
\sin^2 2\theta_m
=
\frac{\sin^2 2\theta}{\left(\cos 2\theta-\frac{2EV}{\Delta m^2}\right)^2+\sin^2 2\theta},
$$
with resonance when
$$
\cos 2\theta = \frac{2EV}{\Delta m^2}.
$$

**Solar MSW:**
- Medium: electrons in the Sun.
- Potential (for \(\nu_e\) vs \(\nu_{\mu,\tau}\)):
$$
V_{\rm Sun}=\sqrt{2}\,G_F\,n_e.
$$
- Evolution is largely coherent flavour conversion through a smoothly varying density profile.

**Shi–Fuller early-Universe resonance:**
- Medium: hot plasma + possible large lepton asymmetry.
- Potential includes asymmetry and finite-temperature corrections; crucially:
  - the bath is collision-dominated,
  - decoherence and production rates matter,
  - goal is not just flavour conversion but **building a relic abundance** of sterile states.

So: Shi–Fuller is “MSW-like resonance” + “Boltzmann production in a collisional medium”.

## 5. Primordial black holes

### 5.1 Why PBHs can be dark matter
If black holes form **before BBN**, they are:
- primordial,
- collisionless,
- interact only via gravity,
so they automatically behave like a dark matter component.

### 5.2 How PBHs form (idea)
Before stars exist, you can’t make “normal” black holes by stellar collapse.
Instead, in the early Universe you can have density perturbations. If a region is overdense enough, it can collapse when it re-enters the horizon.

A useful GR length scale is the Schwarzschild radius.

### 5.3 Derivation of Schwarzschild radius
Use the Newtonian escape speed from a mass \(M\):
$$
v_{\rm esc}^2 = \frac{2GM}{r}.
$$
A black hole forms when the escape speed at the surface reaches the speed of light:
$$
v_{\rm esc}=c.
$$
So
$$
c^2=\frac{2GM}{r}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
r=\frac{2GM}{c^2}\equiv r_s.
$$
That is the Schwarzschild radius.

### 5.4 From our discussion: “does it act like a tiny black hole today?”
Yes: if PBHs exist, they are literally black holes today.
“Tiny” refers to mass: PBHs could be much smaller than stellar black holes, but they can also be massive depending on when/how they formed. As a dark matter component they behave like massive, collisionless objects whose main effect is gravitational.

---

## 6. One-page mental map
- **WIMPs:** thermal equilibrium early; freeze-out when \(n\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim H\); relic density \(\propto 1/\langle\sigma v\rangle\).
- **Axions:** invented for strong CP; DM via misalignment (field frozen when \(H\gg m_a\), oscillates when \(H\sim m_a\), then \(\rho\propto a^{-3}\)).
- **Sterile neutrinos:** produced via tiny mixing (freeze-in); DW (non-resonant) vs SF (MSW-like resonance from lepton asymmetry).
- **PBHs:** form from early overdensities; collisionless gravitational DM.
